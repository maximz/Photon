He is welcomed home to Starling City by his mother Moira, younger sister Thea, and best friend Tommy, but they sense he has changed. Oliver hides the truth about the man he has become, and tries to reconcile with his former girlfriend, Laurel, whom he cheated on with her sister Sara (who died in the shipwreck). While reconnecting with those closest to him, by night Oliver secretly masquerades as a hooded vigilante archer, attempting to fulfill his dying father's entreaty: to right the wrongs of his family, fight the ills of society, and restore Starling City to its former glory. Oliver's first task is to take down corrupt millionaire Adam Hunt, who has scammed millions from various people in Starling City. Laurel's father, police detective Quentin Lance, becomes determined to arrest the vigilante. Meanwhile, it is revealed Oliver's mother has an agenda at odds with her son, having orchestrated a kidnapping to determine what his father told him after the shipwreck.&#160;22"Honor Thy Father"David BarrettStory by:Teleplay by:2012-10-172J7302[]China White33"Lone Gunmen"Guy BeeStory by:Teleplay by:2012-10-242J7303[]DeadshotM.O.44"An Innocent Man"Vince MisianoMoira Kirland2012-10-312J7304[]Diggle awakens in Oliver's hideout, where Oliver offers Diggle a chance to fight at his side and help the city. Diggle turns him down, calling him a murderer. Later, while watching the news, Oliver discovers a connection between Declan, a deathrow inmate, and Jason Brodeur, one of the men on his list. In his vigilante persona, he enlists the help of Laurel to prove the man innocent before he is executed. Working together, the pair uncover the truth, but Jason Brodeur has his bodyguard stage a prison break so that he can have Laurel and the inmate killed before the truth is revealed. Oliver sneaks into the prison dressed as a guard, with a ski mask to hide his face, and saves Laurel and Declan. The bodyguard ultimately confesses to Declan's innocence. Diggle meets with Oliver and agrees to work with him so that he can both protect the city and protect Oliver from losing his humanity. Detective Lance arrests Oliver on suspicion of being the vigilante after seeing footage of him retrieving his disguise from a bag before confronting Deadshot. Meanwhile, Walter discovers that Moira has been keeping the salvaged and sabotaged family yacht hidden in a warehouse.&#160;55"Damaged"Michael SchultzWendy Mericle &amp; Ben Sokolowski2012-11-072J7305[]post-traumatic stress disorder66"Legacies"John BehringMoira Kirland &amp; Marc Guggenheim2012-11-142J7306[]Reston family77"Muse of Fire"David GrossmanStory by:Teleplay by:Geoff Johns2012-11-282J7307[]Helena Bertinelli88"Vendetta"Kenneth FinkBeth Schwartz &amp; Andrew Kreisberg2012-12-052J7308[]Oliver decides to teach Helena that there is justice outside of revenge after witnessing her try to kill the head of the Triad. Diggle expresses his disapproval, believing that Helena cannot be trusted. Oliver shows Helena that they can bring down her father's business by taking out key players and delivering them to the police. Helena starts to buy into the idea, but after an impromptu dinner with Oliver, Tommy, and Laurel leads to an awkward moment, Helena abandons Oliver's approach, believing he was manipulating her. Helena goes after the Triad, killing their leader. As a result, China White and her men go after Frank Bertinelli, believing him to be responsible, but Oliver gets there in time to stop them. Oliver also stops Helena from killing her father, but she refuses to forgive him for allowing the police to arrest Frank and threatens to reveal his identity if he tries to come after her in the future. Meanwhile, Tommy finally admits to Oliver that his father cut him off financially, and asks for a job working at the club that Oliver is attempting to build. Walter also learns more about the secret organization that Moira is a part of.&#160;99"Year's End"John DahlStory by:Teleplay by:2012-12-122J7309[]Edward FyersMalcolm Merlyn1010"Burned"Eagle EgilssonMoira Kirland &amp; Ben Sokolowski2013-01-162J7310[]Garfield Lynns1111"Trust But Verify"Nick CopusGabrielle Stanton2013-01-232J7311[]Ted Gaynor1212"Vertigo"Wendey StanzlerWendy Mericle &amp; Ben Sokolowski2013-01-302J7312[]The Count1313"Betrayal"Guy BeeLana Cho &amp; Beth Schwartz2013-02-062J7313[]Slade WilsonAustralian Intelligence1414"The Odyssey"John BehringStory by:Teleplay by:2013-02-132J7314[]Billy WintergreenShadoCelina Jade1515"Dodger"Eagle EgilssonBeth Schwartz2013-02-202J7315[]Oliver learns of a jewel thief named "Dodger", who uses hostages tagged with bomb collars to steal for him, who has come to Starling City. Felicity suggests that Oliver bug the phone of Detective McKenna Hall, an old friend of Oliver's, to gain information on the Dodger. She also convinces Oliver to ask Detective Hall out on a date so that he can have some down time. The date prompts flashbacks to the island, and Oliver recalling a time where he came upon another individual who was beaten and tied up, but refuses to help for fear that it is a trap set by Fyers. Through the wire tap, Oliver is able to determine the Dodger's next location, but is stunned by a bomb thrown by the thief, who subsequently gets away. To draw out the Dodger, Oliver donates antique jewels to a local auction. It works, but Felicity is caught tracking the thief, who places a bomb collar on her as insurance in his getaway. Oliver manages to stop the Dodger and deactivate the collar. Meanwhile, Moira attempts to make a deal with China White to have Malcolm killed, so that she can leave the secret organization and get Walter back.&#160;1616"Dead to Rights"Glen WinterGeoff Johns2013-02-272J7316[]Guillermo Barrera1717"The Huntress Returns"Guy BeeJake Coburn &amp; Lana Cho2013-03-202J7317[]Coast City1818"Salvation"Nick CopusDrew Z.

The Savior forces the slum lord to confess his atrocities, only to shoot him dead over a live internet broadcast. When The Savior kidnaps the District Attorney, and broadcasts his interrogation, Felicity attempts to track his location for Oliver. The signal continues to move and keeps Oliver from being able to save the attorney. The Savior goes after Roy next, whom he deems as just another gangbanger. Diggle realizes that The Savior is using an abandoned subway car to travel around the city, and Oliver is able to catch the subway car and stop the Savior before he can kill Roy. Afterward, Oliver realizes the secret organization's plans involve The Glades, a neighborhood filled with poverty and crime. Meanwhile, Laurel proves to Dinah and her father, who now believes his daughter survived, that the woman in the picture that Dinah discovered from China was not Sara. Malcolm contacts the Triad to determine who tried to kill him. Moira turns over her co-conspirator Frank Chen to Malcolm, who, dressed in his archer attire, kills Chen and thanks Moira for her loyalty. The flashback to the island shows that Oliver and Slade freed Yao Fei's daughter, but at the cost of Fyers re-acquiring the circuit board.&#160;1919"Unfinished Business"Michael OfferBryan Q. Miller2013-04-032J7319[]After a girl dies from using a new form of Vertigo, Oliver sets out to interrogate the Count and determine who is dealing drugs in the Glades. Oliver quickly determines the Count has lost his mind from the Vertigo overdose he received from Oliver months prior. When news reports state that the Count escaped the facility shortly after he left, Oliver suspects that the Count was faking his mental illness. Meanwhile, Detective Lance finds loose connections between Tommy and Vertigo, and attempts to uncover the truth, which almost leads him to discovering Oliver's hideout. Fortunately, Tommy has all of Oliver's gear stored so that Lance does not find anything. Tommy eventually quits the club after realizing that Oliver did not trust that he had nothing to do with any drug dealing; this leads Tommy to ask his father for a job. Felicity isolates an anti-psychotic compound in the drug, and Oliver realizes that the Count's psychiatrist is the one really behind the re-emergence of Vertigo. Oliver stops the doctor, and opts not to kill the Count, who truly lost his mind from the Vertigo overdose and was the unwitting scapegoat of the doctor's actions. Afterward, Oliver decides to help Diggle track down Deadshot, who was responsible for the death of Diggle's brother. In a flashback, Yao Fei's daughter, Shado, begins training Oliver to use a bow.&#160;2020"Home Invasion"Kenneth FinkBen Sokolowski &amp; Beth Schwartz2013-04-242J7320[]Al SapienzaJ.

The plan works and Oliver, Felicity, and Diggle break into Merlyn Global to hack the mainframe and find the device. Oliver convinces Tommy to get back together with Laurel, but when he learns that he could give up being the vigilante if he stops the Undertaking, Oliver decides to reconcile with Laurel himself; later, Tommy witnesses Oliver and Laurel kissing. That night, Diggle goes after the device, but Malcolm learns of the system hack and has the device moved. The vigilante attempts to kill Malcolm, who reveals to the vigilante that he is the other archer; the two fight and Malcolm gets the upper hand, discovering Oliver's secret. Meanwhile, Walter reveals that he knew that Moira was part of his kidnapping and gives her divorce papers as a result. In a flashback, Fyers reveals that he plans to cripple the Chinese economy by blowing up aircraft going into China. Fyers then murders Yao Fei after forcing him to take credit for the attacks via video recording.&#160;2323"Sacrifice"David BarrettStory by:Teleplay by:2013-05-152J7323[]Malcolm imprisons Oliver and leaves him to die, hung from chains, but he manages to escape and return home.

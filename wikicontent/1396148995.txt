An anonymous phone call leads Lisbon into Red John's trap where she discovers a gravely injured Partridge. Before he dies, he says "Tyger, Tyger." Red John calls Jane from Lisbon's phone, implying to him that he has her. Jane's list of suspects drops to six.&#160;1182"Black-Winged Red Bird"Robert Duncan McNeillTom Szentgyorgyi2013-10-064X5602[]Jane rushes to the crime scene to find Lisbon dazed, with Red John's classic smiley face on her face, but still alive. Later Jane discovers several clues to Red John's identity after Red John murders Sophie Miller.&#160;1193"Wedding in Red"Randy ZiskDaniel Cerone2013-10-134X5603[]In order to focus on Sheriff McAllister, Jane involves the CBI in a case in Napa. Meanwhile Rigsby and Van Pelt decide to get married.&#160;1204"Red Listed"Eric LaneuvilleRebecca Perry Cutter2013-10-204X5604[]When a list of fake Red John suspects is stolen, the innocent men named on it find themselves in danger. Madeleine Hightower and Bob Kirkland return. The existence of a conspiracy using the identification phrase "Tyger, Tyger" amongst California's Law Enforcement personnel is revealed. This suggests that Red John, known for his fascination with Blake's poem, may have strong connections to this organization. Bob Kirkland is murdered by Reede Smith, who tells a police officer to say that he killed him because he tried to run away, and they seal the deal by saying "Tyger, Tyger" (which indicates that they are part of the secret organization). Jane's list of suspects drops to five.&#160;1215"The Red Tattoo"Tawnia McKiernanEoghan Mahony2013-10-274X5605[]private investigator1226"Fire and Brimstone"John F. ShowalterKen Woodruff2013-11-03[]4X5606[]With the new clue in mind, Jane arranges to gather the remaining Red John suspects, Sheriff Thomas McAllister, Reede Smith, Gale Bertram, Ray Haffner and Bret Stiles in one place in hopes of uncovering the serial killer's true identity. Using the information Kira Tinsley gave him before she died, Jane, brandishing a shotgun, makes the five suspects show him their left shoulders revealing that McAllister, Smith and Bertram all have three dots tattooed on the left shoulderâ€”meaning that one of those three is Red John. Lisbon (whom Jane abandons at beach side while en route to the rendezvous with the suspects at his family home) commandeers a car to arrive at Jane's house, and just as she is about to enter, an explosion occurs, throwing her back. The fate of Jane and the Red John suspects is unknown.&#160;1237"The Great Red Dragon"Elodie KeeneJordan Harper2013-11-174X5608[]After the explosion, DNA evidence suggests the burnt bodies were those of Haffner, Stiles and McAllister. Bertram and Smith go on the run, but Smith turns himself in not much later, after managing to escape a series of assassination attempts, realizing his life is in permanent danger. Patrick Jane announces to the media that Red John is Gale Bertram. A bartender recognizes Bertram, who stopped in for a drink, on the television. Bertram bludgeons the bartender to death, then flees. The CBI is disbanded and shut down by the FBI due to the corruption and entanglements which have caused a massive scandal in California law enforcement.&#160;1248"Red John"Chris LongBruno Heller2013-11-244X5607[]After ten years, Jane finally confronts Red John. Meeting with Bertram in the chapel of the cemetery where Jane's wife and daughter are interred, Jane learns that Red John is not Bertram but Sheriff McAllister, who has an operative (Oscar Cordero) shoot Bertram dead. Jane figures out that Brett Partridge, before his death, was able, in his professional capacity, to switch DNA samples. After Cordero is shot dead in the outer sanctum by one of the FBI agents who have traced Jane to the cemetery, Jane is attacked with a knife by a woman who is presumably a Red John acolyte, but Jane manages to take the offensive, chasing McAllister to a nearby park, where he chokes him to death. McAllister begs for his life, even promising to answer questions he knows Jane cannot answer, such as how he (McAllister) knew the seven names on Jane's shortlist. Jane leaves a message for Lisbon telling her that Red John is dead and it's all over.&#160;1259"My Blue Heaven"Simon BakerTom Szentgyorgyi2013-12-014X5609[]Two years have passed since the events of 'Red John' (the discovery that McAllister was Red John, and Jane's killing him), and Janeâ€”who's been living on a Spanish language-speaking island which has no extradition agreement with the United Statesâ€”receives a job offer; all criminal charges against him will be dropped if he agrees to work as a consultant for the FBI. Patrick eventually decides to accept, but on his own terms, which include working with Teresa Lisbon (now a small town police chief in Washington State). Jane writes down a 4-point agreement on a napkin, of which he makes several photocopies, having Abbott sign the copies to indicate agreement with Jane's terms. However, once Jane is back in the United States, Abbott informs him that the 4-point agreement has no legal weight and that his signature on the copies means only that he acknowledged reading what Jane wrote on the napkin. Abbott says that either Jane will work for the Bureau on the Bureau's terms or he will face charges. When Jane refuses to agree to the Bureau's terms, Abbott has Jane taken away to a "detention suite".&#160;12610"Green Thumb"Robert Duncan McNeillDaniel Cerone2013-12-084X5610[]The FBI needs Janeâ€™s help to find a computer programmer who is missing, but he wonâ€™t help them unless Lisbon joins the team as well. It also turns out that the man murdered someone.&#160;12711"White Lines"Guy FerlandKen Woodruff2014-01-054X5611[]Brianna Brown12812"The Golden Hammer"James HaymanMichael Weiss2014-01-124X5612[]David Norona12913"Black Helicopters"Randy ZiskErika Green Swafford2014-03-094X5613[]The FBI team try to track down the killer of a US attorney. Jane goes undercover in a homestead commune. Meanwhile Lisbon asks for LaRoche's help on the wire-tapping case. Despite Rigsby covering LaRoche's back during a search for a suspect, LaRoche receives a fatal gunshot wound from a booby trap.&#160;13014"Grey Water"Geary McLeodDavid Appelbaum2014-03-164X5614[]Rigsby and Van Pelt are attacked in their home and they barely make it out alive. The FBI team helps them to search for potential suspects from previous case logs. Meanwhile Jane and Fischer solve a murder at an oil fracking site.&#160;13115"White as the Driven Snow"Chris LongEoghan Mahony2014-03-234X5615[]After Grace is abducted, the FBI tries to find her but their main suspect has an alibi and a very protective lawyer. Wayne and Patrick come up with an alternative plan. They trick their suspect, Haibach, into leading them to where he's keeping Grace - with his sister in a mountain cabin. However, Rigsby is shot twice when the sister uses Grace as trap. Haibach then takes Patrick and Grace outside and prepares to chop off Patrick's fingers, but Rigsby somehow manages to overpower the sister, saving Patrick by shooting Haibach. Luckily, the other members of the team had also been able to locate their suspects cabin and showed up just in time to take Rigsby to the hospital. The episode closes with Rigsby in a hospital bed, well on the road to recovery; Rigsby and Grace are offered positions at the FBI but they decline them, saying that they were ready for civilian life.&#160;13216[]J.

The FDA changes its regulations such that any unapproved drug is also illegal. As the Club runs out of funds, Rayon—who is addicted to cocaine—begs her father for money and tells Ron that she has sold her life insurance policy to raise money. Ron is thus able to travel to Mexico and get more of the Peptide T. When he returns, Ron finds that Rayon has died after being taken to hospital and given AZT. Saks is also upset by Rayon's death, and she is asked to resign when the hospital discovers that she is linking her patients with the Buyers Club. She refuses to comply and insists that she would have to be fired.As time passes, Ron shows compassion towards gay, lesbian, and transgender members of the club and making money becomes less of a concern – his priority is provision of the drugs. Peptide T gets increasingly difficult to acquire, and in 1987 he files a lawsuit against the FDA. He seeks the legal right to take the protein, which has been confirmed as non-toxic but is still not approved. The judge is compassionate toward Ron but lacks the legal tools to do anything. As the film ends, on-screen text reveals that the FDA later allowed Ron to take Peptide T for personal use, and that he died of AIDS in 1992, seven years later than his doctors initially predicted.Cast[edit]Matthew McConaugheyJennifer GarnerJared LetoDenis O'HareSteve ZahnMichael O'NeillDallas RobertsGriffin DunneKevin RankinAdam DunncameoBradford CoxJohn Tabler as Rick FerrisProduction[edit]Jared Letotransgender womanThe Dallas Morning News[][][][]Dennis HopperWoody Harrelson[]Marc ForsterBrad PittDallas Buyers Club[]Craig GillespieRyan GoslingJean-Marc ValléeMatthew McConaughey[][][][][][][][]Principal photographyNew OrleansLouisiana[]Jennifer Garner[][]Release[edit]trailer[]premiered2013 Toronto International Film Festival[][]International Rome Film FestivalDallas Buyers ClubBlu-rayDVD2013 Toronto International Film FestivalBox office[edit]Dallas Buyers Club[]Critical response[edit]premiere2013 Toronto International Film FestivalDallas Buyers Club[]Rotten TomatoesDallas Buyers Club[]Metacritic[]Richard CorlissTime[]trans womanAIDS[][]Time[][]Golden GlobeScreen Actors Guild AwardAcademy AwardtransgenderLGBTmisogynistic[][][]L.A.

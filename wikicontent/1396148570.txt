Miles takes Neville's wife Julia hostage and exchanges her for their safe return. Neville returns Aaron and Nora, and directs Miles to a defunct power plant where Charlie and Danny have been taken. Charlie reunites with her mother, Rachel, and her brother, Danny, at the plant. Rachel successfully completes the pendant amplifier before killing Strausser when he attempts to assault her. As Miles and Nora rescue Danny and Charlie, Miles faces off with Monroe to give the others time to escape. Monroe forgives Miles' treachery and pleads with him to come back and join his side, just as in Miles' hallucination. However, Miles refuses and fights with Monroe, and Miles then makes a quick exit when Monroe's soldiers appear. All of them escape after Aaron blasts a hole in the exterior wall with Nora's pipe bombs, but stop in their tracks when they hear a thundering sound and see a militia helicopter take flight using Rachel's amplifier and spool its minigun.Flashbacks:1111"The Stand"Steve BoyumAnne Cofell Saunders &amp; Paul Grellong2013-03-252J7111[]Miles' and Charlie's group flee from a newly functional Militia helicopter by hiding in an abandoned diner. The diner is destroyed by rocket fire from the helicopter, but the group survived in the reinforced walk-in refrigerator. After a short discussion, the group decides to warn and aid the rebels in their fight against Monroe's forces. Rachel and Miles are in need of anti-air weaponry, so they seek out another scientist, John Sanborn (Leland Orser), who is in possession of both weapons and another pendant. While alone, Miles tells Rachel that he saw her dead body and would never have abandoned her had he known she was alive. Sanborn informs Rachel that Randall captured Grace and then incapacitates them before revealing that he also is working for Randall. Miles, however, frees himself, incapacitates John, and takes the weapons and the pendant along with Rachel. Charlie and the others go to the rebel headquarters to warn the rebels, but the mood is grim as Commander Ramsey, the rebel leader, believes they can no longer win, but Nora says that Miles will help. Neville and his son Jason (formerly known as Nate) overlook a massacred rebel camp, while Jason voices his disapproval of Monroe's methods, because the rebels don't stand a chance. They eventually find the rebel headquarters and spot Charlie among many people there. Jason refuses to order an air strike, and he and Neville come to blows, with Neville beating him up and telling him to never come home. Neville then orders the air strike and tells Monroe that Jason is dead. Jason proceeds to warn Charlie, who is grateful but says he can't come with her. Monroe's helicopters arrive and the rebels take many casualties before Miles and Rachel arrive with surface-to-air rocket launchers. Miles aims his rocket launcher but is knocked out by the concussion from a missile. Danny then takes the rocket launcher and fires at the helicopter containing the amplifier, the source of power for both Militia helicopters. As the helicopters fall, Danny is killed by stray bullets to his chest. Later, Rachel cuts into Danny's body and pulls out a device with a flashing LED. Earlier, Grace is revealed to be working under duress for Randall to get the elevators working so Randall could go to Level 12 of the unknown location. Later, Randall Flynn and John Sanborn arrive in Philadelphia by car that works via pendant and offer their help to the Monroe Militia.Flashbacks:1212"Ghosts"Miguel SapochnikDavid Rambo &amp; Melissa Glenn2013-04-012J7112[]United States Department of DefenseFlashbacks:1313"The Song Remains the Same"John F.

As a result, over the next 21 days, she is tortured repeatedly until she finally reveals the locations of Miles, Neville and Charlie. John Sanborn, who attacked Miles and Rachel, rescues Nora from the Militia Prison, after injecting her with a substance which causes hallucinations and paranoia. He also steals a pendant and amplifier for the rebels to use. He tells Miles he did so because he didn't want to carry out his orders of killing her and doesn't want to be responsible for people's death. Subsequently, Nora reveals to Miles that she told Monroe everything. Miles, Nora, Jason, Neville, Charlie, Sanborn, and Hudson board a helicopter bound for The Tower, stopping on the way to siphon fuel from vehicles abandoned in an airstrip. During this stop, the pilot of the helicopter and another rebel, Ramsay, were murdered with an X on their throats from a knife, leading to speculation that the murders were carried out by members of the Plains Nation. Charlie, however, points out that it cannot be a local of the area who did it because there is no food or water nearby. It is also confirmed by Ramsay that it was one of the group who did it, and eyes immediately turn to Jason, as he was seen by Charlie speaking to a member of the Monroe Militia back in Atlanta. Jason attempts to flee with Miles in pursuit. Sanborn quickly notices the knife used to murder the two rebels bore the stamp of Annapolis and follows. He tells Miles that it was Hudson who committed the murders, and then he is shot by Hudson himself. Hudson then reveals that Monroe has his wife, and that he was told by the Militia men that he had to kill Miles, Neville, Ramsay, and Sanborn. Hudson and Miles fight, with Hudson gaining the upper hand, but ultimately is shot dead by Jason. Monroe decides that Flynn is no longer of any use, and tells his forces to kill him. Flynn then discloses information about The Tower, including that it holds weapons which make his helicopters seem like toys. This makes Monroe lead an operation to retrieve this weaponry, but their path is blocked by an invading force within The Tower, which have locked Flynn out of the system, preventing him from gaining access to the building. Rachel and Aaron get closer to The Tower. Realizing that The Tower is now surrounded by Militia, Rachel makes the decision that she will fulfill her personal mission of killing Monroe at nightfall, leaving the rest of the Militia to fight for leadership, subsequently leaving Aaron with the chance of approaching the door to The Tower with the override codes. Rachel walks into Monroe's tent and pulls the pin on a grenade in her hands. Monroe and his men, holding guns, try to talk Rachel down and the episode ends with Rachel releasing the lever on the grenade.&#160;1919"Children of Men"Frederick E. O. ToyeDavid Rambo &amp; Jim Barnes2013-05-272J7119[]Rachel unpins the grenade in Monroe's tent, but one of Monroe's bodyguards pushes her out of the way. Another militia soldier tackles Rachel and throws the grenade outside just in time. Aaron witnesses Rachel being led in chains, eliminating his chance to get into the Tower. Rachel is allowed access into the Tower, much to the astonishment of Randall. The group inside the Tower witnesses Monroe's entry as the leader, named Dan Jenkins, orders his men to take their weapons to fight Monroe. ( Dan Jenkins is the same man who was the Tower's commander and who took Randall's order to activate the machine that caused the blackout). Miles lands the helicopter four miles from the Tower On his groups hike to the entrance of the Tower, they run into Aaron. Aaron tells Miles that there is a way into the Tower, but they have to find a way around Monroe's troops. Inside the Tower, Randall shows Monroe the control room, where the U.S. government's satellites still have live feeds of the entire planet. According to Randall, the Tower has the capacity to do anything and is impervious to everything, including the Blackout. However, they first need to go to Level 12. Rachel is shocked when Randall reveals this, but Monroe and his troops enter the elevator, ready to witness the entirety of the Tower's potential. Monroe and his group take the elevator to Level 12, but it stops at Level 11. Monroe's men step out of the elevator, but an alarm sounds and Jenkin's men, using superior coil gun weaponry, begin to take down Monroe's men. Rachel runs for cover in a room that was a vice-presidential bunker, but Monroe follows and pins her, demanding to know who the attackers are. Outside, Tom Neville and Jason take out the Militia encampment's power source with grenades. Aaron and Miles rush to open the doors of the Tower as Monroe's men descend on them. However, only Miles, Charlie, Nora, and Aaron can get in, leaving Jason and Neville outside when the door shuts. The Militia captures Jason and Neville, but they manage to plot a revolt with the assistance of the local commanders they meet during interrogation. At the Tower, Rachel tells Monroe that he killed her son and her son's death was his fault, but Monroe tells her that he doesn't know how he got out of control and reveals to Rachel that he also has a son, too. Meanwhile, Miles, Charlie, Nora, and Aaron are in the battle with the attackers. Monroe decided to help Rachel save Charlie, but he has to kill Miles. During the fight, Miles and Nora are separated from Charlie and Aaron, and Monroe separated from Rachel, with Miles face to face with Monroe. Rachel, Charlie, and Aaron are captured by the attackers and are led to a place where there are families. They grow their own food and live to protect the Tower, especially Level 12. Rachel realizes that the inhabitants at the Tower are the workers and scientists. Grace Beaumont and Dan Jenkins burn Doctor Warren's journal in order to prevent Rachel and Aaron from turning the lights back on. This is because there are two possible results of deactivating the nanites. It could turn the lights back on, or it could set the world on fire.Flashbacks:2020"The Dark Tower"Charles BeesonStory by:Teleplay by:2013-06-032J7120[]ICBMGuantanamo BayFlashbacks:Season 2 (2013–14)[edit]TitleDirected byWritten byOriginal air date211"Born in the U.S.A."Steve BoyumEric Kripke2013-09-252J7701[]Set six months after the events of Season 1, the story is broken into three storylines.

It was hoped her father, Gene Porter was still alive and living in the town, which he was, in order to help Rachel recover. It is confirmed that the nuclear missiles bound for Atlanta and Philadelphia struck their targets, creating widespread devastation and throwing both the Monroe Republic and the Georgia Federation into disarray. Meanwhile, in a refugee camp outside of Savannah, Georgia, Neville and Jason desperately search for Julia, Neville’s wife. They witness the return of the U.S. Government, and a group, calling themselves "The Patriots".

Meanwhile, the town discovers that the sheriff is dead and Miles is held captive. Rachel tries to organize a rescue for Miles, but no one agrees, eventually leading to trying to rescue him on her own. While Rachel is leaving the town, Gene and the others join in.

It is revealed later that a key member of Titus’ group is actually a Patriot. Back at Willoughby, Aaron reveals to his girlfriend Cynthia the truth behind the Blackout and his resurrection.

The pair let Charlie go, and ride off with Monroe, only to have Monroe flee in an escape. Charlie manages to save Adam but not his partner. In Savannah, Neville organizes an assassination attempt on Allenford, only to turn on the would-be assassin to further his goal of infiltrating the Patriots. At the tent, Allenford allows Neville to join the Patriots.

A warrior, previously seen working for the Patriots, tries to get Titus to back down from attacking but Titus resists. In the house, Jessica, Titus's wife begs Rachel not to give her back to Titus, because she's afraid of him. Miles offers himself to Titus in exchange for the safety of the town residents. Titus agrees, but also sends in a spy to check on his wife. The spy and Rachel discover she killed herself so she won't have to return to Titus. As the last wagon out of town is leaving, Titus discovers the deception, and his tribe begins to brutally attack the town. Meanwhile, in the Savannah Refugee Camp, Tom Neville tells Jason they are now Patriots, working for the U.S. Government, until they "climb to the top and kill them all." He burns his wife's picture. Upon returning to their tent at the end of the day, they are attacked and beaten unconscious. After waking, they are questioned by the Patriots. The group reveals they know Neville’s true identity.

Aaron says he is pretty sure he caused the men to light on fire, and Rachel thinks it might be the nanotech. Both Monroe and Charlie and a contingent of Texas Rangers arrive in town shortly after. After pointing guns at each other, the Rangers and Patriots lower their weapons. However, the Patriots make effort to hide their activities from the Rangers. Miles contacts the lead Ranger, who he tried to kill when he was in the Monroe army, as he is their best shot at starting a war with the Patriots. The lead Ranger, Fry demands proof to take back otherwise Texas will sign a treaty with the Patriots. Charlie and Monroe make contact with Miles and aid him in the capture of a Patriot soldier, the same soldier that was working with Titus. As they prepare to question him at a hidden location, Aaron and Rachel arrive due to a vision Aaron had of the location. As they hide and the Ranger arrives, Miles discovers the soldier committed suicide with a cyanide tooth. Wondering what to do about evidence, Monroe kills Ranger Fry in order to frame the Patriots as a way to start the war. In the Savannah Refugee Camp, a wagon is being mobbed by desperate people who want to board the wagon. Neville speaks with Allenford, who tells him she is being called to D.C. and he is to accompany her as her security force. Along the way, they are ambushed by Patriots who try to assassinate Allenford. Neville and Allenford escape, although Allenford got a bullet wound. When they stop to rest, Allenford reveals that the wagon was actually taking people to reprogramming centers, the same one his son is now at. She tells Neville that the Patriots were brainwashing innocent people to become members of the Patriots.

He rehabilitates in a farmhouse outside of town. Dr. Horn, science adviser to the Patriots, arrives, having been drawn by news of Rachel's presence and strange happenings that have occurred since her arrival. He is implied throughout the episode to have a dark sadistic side. With the help of Gene, Dr. Horn learns that Aaron was the cause of the strange happenings, including the spontaneous combustion of two soldiers. Miles and company are aware of Dr. Horn's interest in Aaron and conspire to help him escape town. Aaron won't leave town without his girlfriend, who ultimately agrees to come with him. Gene agrees to help Aaron escape, but is coerced by the Patriots into setting up his capture. Miles on a hunch observes Gene aiding the Patriots which devastates Rachel.

O'Bannon2013-11-132J7708[]Miles and Rachel are interrogating a captured Patriot soldier when they are informed by Charlie about a statement Truman made to the town. Truman claimed Miles and Aaron were behind the store bombing. Rachel tells Charlie that the Patriots will never stop looking for them unless they kill Horn first. After realizing the Patriot HQ is in the town paper factory, they devise a plan send Rachel to drop poison gas into the factory. Monroe, Aaron, and Cynthia are at a location waiting for Miles to come for them. Cynthia asks Aaron if he killed Carl, her ex-husband, and he says he did but he can't control his powers. Aaron breaks down in tears and asks Cynthia to leave him alone. They are discovered by Patriot soldiers sent by Horn, which Monroe attempts to fight off. On the verge of being overwhelmed by too many Patriots, Monroe flees, leaving Aaron and Cynthia to be captured. Miles calls off the mission when Gene enters the factory, but Rachel continues on anyway. As Rachel prepares to drop the poison, Aaron and Cynthia are led into the factory. Miles stops her just in time. Inside the factory, a drugged Aaron begs Horn to let Cynthia go. Cynthia realizes Gene is there and realizes he is collaborating with the Patriots. Horn refuses to let her go, saying she is assurance that Aaron will not torch the factory, and order Gene to leave. As Cynthia sits in a cell, she hears Aaron screaming from being tortured by Horn. Horn observes Aaron’s skin healing when cut. Miles, Rachel, and Charlie kidnap Gene and question him. He says the Patriots were the ones who gave him the medicine way back when and he took it. Truman shows up at their place demanding they all come out. Gene emerges, alone, and holds a knife to Truman's throat. The soldiers chase Miles, Rachel, and Charlie. Truman holds a gun to Gene's head and takes him back to the factory. Horn brings Cynthia into the room to see if Aaron can heal her when they cut her. Aaron screams as they stab her in the back and the fire flashes. In North Carolina, Neville walks into a Patriot camp to see Commander Roger Allenford. When asked his business, Neville holds up a ring. He convinces Allenford that although the commander’s wife is alive, she is an enemy of the Patriots. Neville says if Allenford brings his own wife in for justice, it would raise his career in the eyes of the Patriots. Neville further convinces the commander later that bringing her in would ultimately protect Allenford’s son and the commander’s life. At the barn where Allenford is being held captive, she asks Roger (her husband) to kill Neville and Jason and then run away with her, and Roger says there is no place to run to and shoots her.Flashback:299"Everyone Says I Love You"Steve BoyumTrey Callaway &amp; Paul Grellong2013-11-202J7709[]Miles, Rachel, and Charlie move to rescue Aaron. They discover all the soldiers knocked out and Aaron and Cynthia gone. Following their escape route, they look in a fog shrouded forest, with the Patriots searching too. They are eventually joined by Monroe and follow the trail to a local high school. At the high school, Aaron wakes up next to Cynthia, alive and apparently healed from her injuries. He discovers a small boy who says he lives there. After Cynthia wakes up, she notes that she does not see the boy and it becomes apparent that the boy is a manifestation of the nanotech. The nanotech says it has been helping Aaron because he woke it up. The Patriots arrive at the high school just before Miles and company. A competing search begins for Aaron. In one room, Miles collapses from his arm infection and confesses his love for Rachel as Patriots burst in. Neville boards a train bound for Washington D.C. with Jason and Commander Allenford. They are headed for the White House. His wife boards the train too, although she is newly married. After reuniting, they conspire to greater political ambitions.Horn discovers Aaron fleeing and holds him at gunpoint. After Horn shoots dead Cynthia, the boy reappears. In his grief, Aaron requests that the boy kill all the Patriots in the school. He complies, but wonders why Aaron did not ask for Cynthia to be healed. The boy is confused about the conflicting requests and vanishes, leaving Cynthia dead and Aaron alone.Flashback:3010"The Three Amigos"Charles BeesonDavid Rambo &amp; Anne Cofell Saunders2014-01-082J7710[]After the group is reunited, Charlie and Monroe save Gene from the Patriots and escape to a farmhouse. Gene helps Miles tend his injury. The next day, Aaron stands next to Cynthia's grave, wondering why the Nanotech told him to go to Spring City, Oklahoma yesterday. Meanwhile, when Miles wakes up, Monroe asks him where his son is. Miles then tells him that his son was in Mexico and his name is Connor. Miles tells him that he'll take him to his son. Miles, Rachel and Monroe then travel to Mexico to find Connor. Rachel is not happy going with Monroe when he killed her son in the past. Meanwhile, Aaron leaves the farmhouse and journeys to Spring City, Oklahoma. Gene and Charlie discover that Aaron is gone. When Miles, Rachel and Monroe enter into Mexico, Monroe discovers that Connor became part of the Mexican cartel. Connor recognizes Miles at the bar. After Monroe reveals everything to his son, Connor threatens him and tells his father to go away. At night, Monroe blames Miles for sending his son to Mexico, which led Connor to become like this. Monroe goes back to Connor to talk to him. Connor tells his father that he knows that Miles sent him to Mexico because it is to keep him safe from Monroe. Monroe tells him that he and Connor should lead the Monroe Republic and take it back. Then, one of members of the Mexican cartel captures Monroe and Connor had him detained. Rachel and Miles realize that Monroe has been captured by the Mexican cartel. Meanwhile, Gene notices two wagons are being brought to Willoughby by the Patriots. So Gene and Charlie decide to find out. Meanwhile, Tom, Julia, Jason and the Patriots, including Commander Roger Allenford, head to Washington D.C. and enter the White House, where the party is held. Julia knows that her new husband, Victor Doyle, who is the member of the Patriots, is going to be promoted as the new Chief of Staff. Julia and Tom decided to kill the first Chief of Staff, Bill Harlow, so that Julia's new husband could be promoted as the Chief of Staff. After this succeeds, Julia will force her new husband, Doyle, to let Tom be promoted into his security detail. Tom attempts to poison Harlow's drink, but gets distracted and fails, but Tom manages to enter Harlow's room and attack him, putting poison in his throat, killing him. Meanwhile, outside of Willoughby, Charlie kills two Patriot members. Charlie and Gene discover that the Patriots were bringing oranges to the town. In Spring City, Oklahoma Aaron arrives, but no one is there. Aaron is devastated by Cynthia's death and wants to know why he was brought here. But then, Aaron encounters Grace Beaumont. At the town of Willoughby, the Patriots inject the oranges with something in it and give the oranges to the townspeople.&#160;3111"Mis Dos Padres"Michael OfferRockne S. O'Bannon &amp; Ben Edlund2014-01-152J7711[]Monroe fights for his son; Jason turns spy; more surprises await Aaron in Spring City. Aaron meets Grace in Spring City, Oklahoma. Aaron believes he was sent there to find her. Inside, Aaron finds Priscilla, his first wife. Aaron and Priscilla discover they have a connection with the nanotech and have both been seeing hallucinations and fireflies. They were both involved in the making of a code that allowed the nanotech to communicate. Connor marches him as prisoner to his mansion. Connor suggests that they sell him to the highest bidder. Miles and Rachel plan to rescue him. Monroe, who is behind bars, attempts to convince Connor to believe him, but when that doesn't work, Miles bashes him over the head and releases Monroe. Monroe tells Miles he can't leave, not when the blame would lie on Connor. Miles runs for it, but is captured. Connor punishes Monroe for trying to escape by whipping him in front of an audience, which includes Rachel. Rachel finds a way into the house, and is caught by Connor, who pushes a key into her hand. She releases Miles and Monroe, but they are caught on the way out and Conner is threatened for his betrayal. They brawl with the gang, and they take Conner with them when they run. Monroe tells Connor they will get back his territory, but they have to get rid of the Patriots first. Charlie and Gene spy on the construction of a US Patriots tent. When Gene spots a friend of theirs, they go to rescue him. Gene sneaks in, only to find that his friend is dead. Charlie comes after him, but they are both caught by the majority of the armed Patriots. Truman brings them to another tent and releases their handcuffs. They are led into the tent, where it is revealed that there is a breakout of typhus. They are building a quarantine camp for the outbreak in the general populace. Tom delivers a bouquet of flowers to Julia and presses her about becoming security for her new husband, Doyle, who is now the Chief of Staff. Jason and Neville discover that there are new re-education camps being opened all across the United States. Neville and Julia argue about what she is doing to protect him. Someone broke into the Chief of Staff's office and Julia believed it to be Neville, but he denies it. Jason admits to the break-in. Jason is quickly found by security and taken away.&#160;3212"Captain Trips"Steve BoyumPaul Grellong &amp; Jim Barnes2014-01-222J7712[]A typhus outbreak threatens Willoughby; Aaron receives a visit from the nanotech; Tom and Julia try to find out where Jason is. Grace leaves Aaron and Priscilla from Spring City, Oklahoma. Aaron receives the visit of the Nanotech taking the appearance of Cynthia, saying that he and Priscilla have to go to Lubbock, Texas. Meanwhile in the quarantine camp, Rachel shows up to help the ill, also getting more info about the disease. She finds out that the Patriots are poisoning people with problems (epilepsy, alcohol addiction) to make a pure race and are using the outbreak as a cover. She assumes that the Patriots have an antidote for the virus which they created. When Gene becomes sick she sends a note to Miles and Monroe to get it. Miles and Monroe are outside the camp, and they look for the antidote in a Patriots' warehouse. Not finding anything, they kidnap Truman, injecting him with infected blood to force him to reveal the location of the antidote. Connor accompanies Truman into his office where he can retrieve the antidote. However, he is surrounded by Patriot soldiers before he can leave, holding Truman at gunpoint. In Washington, Julia and Tom try to get information about the incarceration of their son Jason. Julia searches her new husband's office and finds out that he is in Kenilworth Prison. Julia and Tom try to capture her husband, Doyle, the new Chief of Staff, in order to force him to show them to their son. However, he learns of their plan and has them both arrested.Flashback:3313"Happy Endings"Ernest DickersonDavid Rambo &amp; Trey Callaway2014-01-292J7713[]Charlie and Rachel race to Gene's aid as he suffers a crisis from his illness. He stops breathing, but they manage to revive him. Conner holds Truman prisoner, with Truman urging a soldier to shoot Conner, but before the soldier can shoot he is killed by Miles. Conner handcuffs the other soldiers and delivers the antidote to Rachel and Charlie. They load Gene into a wagon and all depart the quarantine camp, but Truman escapes and injects the antidote onto him. Monroe, Conner, and Charlie depart for New Vegas, where Monroe intends to hire mercenaries. They meet Duncan, a female warlord, and Monroe wants to talk to her, but she tells them to walk back. Charlie then pulls a gun on her very quickly, but Monroe convinces both Duncan's guards and Charlie to stand down. He bargains with Duncan for some of her men. During the night, Charlie and Conner are lying under a blanket together, talking about what they had just done, when Monroe comes, obviously upset with them. Back at camp, Miles and Rachel go to the "drive-in" together. Rachel says "I think 20 years is plenty of foreplay", and they kiss. In order to get the diamonds to pay Duncan, Monroe, Conner, and Charlie hatch a plan to rob the casino. Monroe agrees to be in a prize fight that night, drawing the guards away. Conner pretends to be drunk and falls in the casino, drawing all the attention while Charlie escapes with the diamond lock box, later revealed to be a fake. Conner retrieves the real one, but Conner and Monroe are caught before leaving New Vegas. Neville is being held captive at the capital, where he is clearly malnourished and abused. He is brought to the President named Jack Davis. The President threatens Neville with Julia's safety to get Neville to hunt down Monroe and assassinate him. Neville told the President that he needs Jason to come with him also. After arriving at Willoughby, Texas, Neville and Jason, who has been released too, meets with Truman, who tells them if they fail, he'll send word to Washington and orders Julia to be killed. Later, Neville finds Miles's camp and swears to him that he wants to get revenge on the Patriots for the death of his wife. Aaron and Priscilla arrive in Lubbock, Texas, where they find Peter, the third member of their MIT nanotech developing group. Peter is a born-again Christian, who is working miracles thanks to the nanotech helping him. A blind and burned woman who was in the Atlanta bombing is brought forward and Peter prays over her, with both Aaron and Priscilla seeing the fireflies over him. In front of his church, Peter completely heals her. Peter locks Aaron and Priscilla in a room after they reveal the truth, he says that the people's faith cannot waver.&#160;3414"Fear and Loathing"Liz FriedlanderAnne Cofell Saunders &amp; Matt Pitts2014-02-262J7714[]Monroe and Connor are trapped in New Vegas. The only means of escape is if they fight each other to the death, in which case only one of them will walk out alive. Charlie returns to New Vegas to convince Duncan to help Monroe and Connor escape. Duncan refuses, and Charlie is then locked up and put to work. Monroe teaches Connor all of his weaknesses, including that he has a blind spot on his left side. He also reveals to Connor that he was partly responsible for the death of Emma, Connor's mother. This fuels Connor's rage. When they fight, Conner is about to kill Monroe, but then Charlie saves Duncan from being killed. Duncan in turn repays Charlie by letting Monroe and Connor escape. After they escape, Duncan gives them several men to take down the Patriots, only to take orders from Charlie. Meanwhile, Tom and Jason discovers that Doyle came to Willoughby and is turning a quarantine camp into a re-education camp. Later, Miles is suspicious of Tom and fears that he and Jason will betray him again. He and Rachel corner them, and Neville admits to them that his wife Julia is indeed alive and that the Patriots are making them hunt down Monroe in exchange for Julia's life. Aaron keeps having the nanite-produced visions of Cynthia, who tells him to "Save us". After Peter repeatedly persists that Aaron do something, Aaron is caught in the middle because Priscilla wants to let the nanotech die. Aaron finally tricks Peter into thinking he is going to fix an error in the code, but instead creates a virus in the code in an attempt to shut down the nanotech, but the computer explodes, knocking Aaron and Priscilla out. Aaron then wakes up in an apartment with Priscilla on March 5, 2014, with the entire world seemingly repowered and never affected by the blackout.&#160;3515"Dreamcatcher"Roxann DawsonBen Edlund &amp; Paul Grellong2014-03-052J7715[]Aaron wakes up in a world were there is still power, married to Priscilla, and running a company. He thinks it is a dream, but ignores it. When he arrives at work, two of his employees bring him into a room and present him the code. There is a blank space; the part that Aaron erased in the previous episode. The employees try to convince Aaron to complete the code. Then, suddenly, Charlie appears and kills the employees. After Charlie reveals everything to Aaron, he slowly realizes that the nanotech have created that world as an illusion in an attempt to make him fix the code that would save it. Charlie says that she is the part of Aaron's mind which is trying to fight against the nanites. Then, to Aaron's shock, Charlie is killed by the nanotech in the form of Dr. Horn and the other Patriots. Aaron escapes and seeks out Rachel in Chicago. She, however, has no memory of him, but he convinces her to help him. They depart to Miles's house with Dr. Horn in hot pursuit. On their way to Mile's place, Aaron reveals to Rachel all that is happening, but she is convinced that he is crazy. Aaron tells her all of her secrets that she told him in the Blackout world, and this convinces her that they did once know each other. Once they arrive at Miles's house, he tries to convince Miles as well, but he thinks Aaron is nuts. Just then, Monroe walks through the door, but he, too, cannot remember Aaron. Miles and Monroe both refer Aaron as 'Beardy Mcgee'. As Aaron gets frustrated, Dr. Horn and his soldiers bust through the door and take Aaron hostage. As he is being carried away, his wish that his friends would remember themselves comes true. They slaughter all the soldiers. Rachel, now in her right mind, asks Aaron how he could wake up from the dream. Aaron explains that jumping from a high place usually wakes him up. The group head over to a building, where Aaron attempts to jump. As he is about to fall, the nanites in the form of Priscilla appear to him, and they beg him to come and live in that world forever. Aaron longs to stay, but he knows that it is all fake, so he falls backwards off the building. As Priscilla/the nanites scream, Aaron wakes up in his workroom at night, bound to a chair. There, the nanotech, in the form of Dr. Horn, attempt to force him to fix the code through torture. However, with the help from his own mind, he discovers how to control the dream he is in and manages to break free and scare the nanites away. Then, Aaron seemingly awakens back in the unpowered world. He and Priscilla go to see Miles and Rachel; along the way, they see signs of the nanotech dying and the power flickering back to life. When they meet up, an unnatural lightning storm begins, which is perceived to be the nanotech's dying strikes as it releases all the energy it had been absorbing. A lightning bolt eventually strikes Rachel, stopping her heart. Aaron enters the code so that the nanotech can heal her, and learns that this, too, was an illusion designed to trick Aaron into entering the code to save the nanotech. Dr Horn/the nanites appear to Aaron and say that they will move onto 'other things'. Aaron then wakes up in the real world, where Peter is smiling at him and Priscilla. He is happy that the nanotech is fixed, and he lets Aaron and Priscilla go. After leaving the town, Aaron and Priscilla continue on their journey back to Willoughby. They suspect that the nanotech is not finished with them.&#160;3616"Exposition Boulevard"Nick CopusDavid Rambo &amp; Trey Callaway2014-03-122J7716[]The Patriot ActFlashback:Guantanamo Bay, Cuba3717"Why We Fight"Frederick E.

Gene tries to go into town to convince local bar operator Marion to convince the townspeople to side with them. Meanwhile, Monroe and the others has found more of Duncan's men, one of Duncan's tribe member reveals that Duncan was killed by the Patriots, because the Patriots are hunting down war clans. Their new leader tells Monroe they will fight under him. Monroe does want to fight, and gets his chance with a large group of fighters. With a new fighting force, Monroe moves to attack the reeducation camp and kill every patriot soldier there. Meanwhile, Neville had been captured by Doyle. In the process of being murdered by Doyle, Monroe initiates his attack, and Neville is able to get free. He kills Doyle and escapes with Jason. At the bar, as Marion is speaking with Gene, Truman arrives for dinner (he and Marion are engaged). Miles and Gene hide. They had successfully convinced Marion of their cause until she walks outside with Truman and learns of the camp attack. Marion is horrified, and tells Truman of Miles and Gene. The two manage to escape. Monroe's forces find a journal written in Arabic. After translating, the group learns that Patriot cadets will be used to attack Austin, seat of Texas government. Later, at the damaged reeducation camp, Truman knows that it was Neville who killed Doyle. However, Neville tells Truman to report to Washington D.C. and to say that Doyle was killed by Monroe's forces because he couldn't handle them, but Truman can.&#160;3818[]2014-04-0239192014-04-2340202014-04-3041212014-05-0742222014-05-14Ratings[edit][]Season 1 (2012–13)[edit]No.TitleAir dateRatings/Share1"Pilot"2012-09-174.1/11[]1.8N/A[]N/A2"Chained Heat"2012-09-243.4/9[]2.34.875.7[]3"No Quarter"2012-10-013.2/8[]2.14.485.3[]4"The Plague Dogs"2012-10-083.0/8[]1.94.224.9[]5"Soul Train"2012-10-153.3/9[]1.94.105.2[]6"Sex and Drugs"2012-10-293.0/7[]1.74.134.6[]7"The Children's Crusade"2012-11-052.8/7[]2.04.724.8[]8"Ties That Bind"2012-11-122.6/7[]1.83.994.4[]9"Kashmir"2012-11-192.6/7[]1.84.414.4[]10"Nobody's Fault But Mine"2012-11-262.9/8[]1.74.034.6[]11"The Stand"2013-03-252.6/7[]1.43.804.0[]12"Ghosts"2013-04-012.2/6[]1.43.273.6[]13"Song Remains The Same"2013-04-082.2/6[]1.53.573.7[]14"The Night The Lights Went..."2013-04-222.0/6[]0.81.982.8[]15"Home"2013-04-291.8/6[]1.53.423.3[]16"The Love Boat"2013-05-062.0/5[]1.43.333.4[]17"The Longest Day"2013-05-131.9/5[]1.33.433.2[]18"Clue"2013-05-201.9/5[]1.43.263.2[]19"Children of Men"2013-05-271.9/5[]TBATBATBATBA20"The Dark Tower"2013-06-032.0/5[]TBATBATBATBASeason 2 (2013–14)[edit]No.TitleAir dateRatings/Share1"Born in the U.S.A."2013-09-25[][]1.12.792.9[]2"There Will Be Blood"2013-10-02[][]1.02.772.6[]3"Love Story"2013-10-09[][]1.02.492.5[]4"Patriot Games"2013-10-16[][]1.1N/A2.5N/A5"One Riot, One Ranger"2013-10-23[][]1.02.492.4[]6"Dead Man Walking"2013-10-30[][]0.92.462.3[]7"The Patriot Act"2013-11-06[][]1.12.712.5[]8"Come Blow Your Horn"2013-11-13[][]0.9N/A2.4[]9"Everyone Says I Love You"2013-11-20[][]0.92.392.3[]10"The Three Amigos"2014-01-08[][]0.92.222.4[]11"Mis Dos Padres"2014-01-15[][]1.02.402.3[]12"Captain Trips"2014-01-22[][]1.02.212.5[]13"Happy Endings"2014-01-29[][]0.92.192.2[]14"Fear and Loathing"2014-02-26[][]0.9N/A[]N/A15"Dreamcatcher"2014-03-05[][]0.9N/A[]N/A16"Exposition Boulevard"2014-03-12[][]17"Why We Fight"2014-03-19[][]References[edit]^"NBC Announces Fall 2012 Premiere Dates for 'Grimm', 'Revolution', 'The Voice,' 'Animal Practice' &amp; More"TV By The Numbers.

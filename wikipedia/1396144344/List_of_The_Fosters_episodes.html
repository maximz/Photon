Mariana's friend Kelsey gets caught with Jesus' pills but she claims Callie sold them to her. Jesus convinces Mariana to admit the truth but he takes the blame and claims he was selling his pills to prove that he didn't need medication. Lena and Stef apologize to Callie for not trusting her. Lena and Stef reveal their decision on Jude and Callie. They decide that they will let them stay until their social worker can find them a permanent home. Until then, Jude will bunk with Jesus while Callie stays with Mariana, much to her distress.

<td class="description" style="border-bottom:3px solid #88ACE0" colspan="7">Brandon is playing the piano in the music room of his high school in the very first scene. While he is playing, Callie walks in the room and says how amazing it is to see him playing again. The two talk about their very first time in the music room where Brandon played her his song about family. This time he adds both Jude and Callie in the song. At first when he adds Callie, he jokingly bangs on the keys. But then he changes the tempo into his actual romantic feelings for her. Callie reminds him that she is getting adopted. This doesn't affect Brandon. Later, down in the courtyard, Callie gets a call from he ex-boyfriend Wyatt. He tells her she looks really good. Confused by this Callie replies, “How would you know?” He asks her to turn around and he’s standing right behind her! The two ex's hug. Brandon looks out of the music room window and sees the whole scene. Needless to say, he is extremely jealous. At school with Wyatt and Callie, she wants to hear the truth from Wyatt about when she ran away and called Stef and Lena. He tells her that while he did call them and rat her out, he later had a change of heart and ran away before Callie could confront him. When Callie gets confused and asks, “Why?” all Wyatt’s says in response is, “You know why.” Inside the school Anchor Beach, Jesus is in class asking Emma to go to the Winter Ball with him. She tells him she has a date already. Meanwhile, Mariana is at her locker when Zac’s Mom, runs up to her. She is in a much better mood then before when she called Mariana a whore through a phone call. Zac's mom also says that she’s going to help Lena with the dance Metropolis. When Zac sees them and joins them, he is a very embarrassed to find his Mom talking to Mariana. However after his mother leaves, Mariana tells Zac that she should see a doctor. Zac shuts that idea down right away. Changing the subject, she thinks they both should go to the dance. But with his Mom chaperoning, Zac doesn’t think it’s the greatest idea. Outside of the police station, Stef runs into Mike where she explains that she isn’t too happy about Brandon being home alone all night while he’s working night shifts. Mike says that Dani is there every night and that things are great. Right before she’s about to go home, Stef gets an extremely surprising visit from Ana. She threatens Stef and reveals that her son gave her money to change her testimony for the case. And if Stef doesn’t give her $10,000 she’s going to go to the DA. Later that night at the house, Stef walks into Jesus’ room. She asks him if he wants to go back on his ADHD medication so he can focus better and hopefully gain a better attitude. Jesus reassures her and says he’s fine and that he needs more time to test out this lifestyle without his meds. She simply nods in agreement. As she’s about to leave his room, she brings up Ana. She asks if Jesus has been in contact with her at all, and he instantly says he hasn’t and does not know what she is talking about.In Mariana and Callie’s room, the two are taking about the dance. Mariana does not want to go to the dance without Zac. Callie tells her that she isn’t going with anyone. But Mariana is quick to tell her Wyatt came struttin’ back into town recently. Mariana is still in shock that Zac hasn’t asked her out. It’s then that Callie jokingly brings up the “panty” thing once again. In Stef and Lena’s bedroom, the two are discussing Wyatt’s return to Anchor Beach. They’re both happy that this might take Callie’s attention away from Brandon. However,with Wyatt, he gets a text from Callie saying he can come back to school, she just needs to know the address to where he’s staying now. That’s when we see him getting all going to sleep in his car, pillow, blankets and all. That’s right, he’s homeless and has to live in a car! Unfortunately for him, the next morning after leaving his car to get ready for school (an outdoor shower), he comes back to find the car being towed. At school, Mariana tries to walk up to Zac so she can ask him to the dance, but he does not let her. Instead, he leads her to her locker where he has a cute “Mystery Date” themed card on her door. It ends up being his way of asking her to the dance. Later at the dance, Callie wins queen. However, this is clearly part of Vico and Talya's plan to set her up. At the back of the dance, there are students in a room with an "Out of Order" sign on the door drinking alcohol. When they are finished drinking Jesus sees Emma's date drunk and picks a fight with him. This leaves Emma furious and she tells him to stay away from her. Unfortunately, Talya tells the principal about the alcohol students were drinking and when Sanchez catches the students, they tell her that Callie Jacob bought the alcohol and that is why they voted for her. While Callie is being accused, they find a fake I.D. in her purse.Brandon quickly walks in and takes the blame saying that he set her up because she hurt him. Brandon is taken away in handcuffs. While he sits in the police car with Mike and Stef, he confesses everything.&#160;</td>

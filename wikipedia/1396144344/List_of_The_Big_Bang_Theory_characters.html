He shares an apartment in <a href="/wiki/Pasadena,_California" title="Pasadena, California">Pasadena</a> with colleague and friend Dr. Sheldon Cooper. Unlike his equally geeky friends, Leonard is interested and quite adept in building interpersonal and social relationships with others. Compared to his friends he is relatively successful with women. The writers have toyed with a romance between him and next-door neighbor <a href="/wiki/Penny_(The_Big_Bang_Theory)" title="Penny (The Big Bang Theory)">Penny</a> since the pilot, with their <a href="/wiki/Unresolved_sexual_tension" title="Unresolved sexual tension" class="mw-redirect">unresolved sexual tension</a> being a major force for drama. Leonard dated Penny for most of Season 3, although they had dated briefly at the end of Season 1. Aside from Penny, Leonard has had romantic relationships with coworker Leslie Winkle, physician <a href="#Stephanie_Barnett">Stephanie Barnett</a>, an unnamed French literature PhD, and <a href="/wiki/North_Korea" title="North Korea">North Korean</a> spy Joyce Kim. Following his breakup with Penny, Leonard began a relationship with Raj's sister Priya in Season 4, and it is implied they had a brief sexual encounter before the start of the series on an occasion when Priya visited Raj. The two attempted a long-distance relationship after Priya moved back to India, but Leonard eventually broke up with her in Season 5 after she admitted to cheating on him with her former boyfriend. In Season 5's "The Beta Test Initiation", Leonard and Penny start dating anew though their relationship is rocky. Leonard's family includes other accomplished scientists: his mother, <a href="#Beverly_Hofstadter">Dr. Beverly Hofstadter</a>, is a world-renowned <a href="/wiki/Psychiatrist" title="Psychiatrist">psychiatrist</a>, his sister is a <a href="/wiki/Biologist" title="Biologist">biologist</a> and his father an <a href="/wiki/Anthropologist" title="Anthropologist">anthropologist</a>. Also, his brother Michael is a Harvard law professor. It is mentioned in the season 2 episode "The Maternal Capacitance" that Leonard is the least successful member of his family. He is also known to be lactose intolerant and cannot process corn, as Sheldon states in "Pilot". Leonard also plays the cello. The cause of the elevator not working is also due in part to Leonard (and Sheldon) as the experimental rocket fuel he was developing was improperly mixed within their apartment and Sheldon threw the canister into the elevator shaft right before the explosion.</p>

<p>Dr. Sheldon Lee Cooper (<a href="/wiki/Jim_Parsons" title="Jim Parsons">Jim Parsons</a>) is a <a href="/wiki/Theoretical_physicist" title="Theoretical physicist" class="mw-redirect">theoretical physicist</a>, possessing a Bachelor of Science, Master of Science, PhD, an <a href="/wiki/Doctor_of_Science" title="Doctor of Science">ScD</a>, and an IQ of 187. Originally from <a href="/wiki/East_Texas" title="East Texas">East Texas</a>, he was a <a href="/wiki/Child_prodigy" title="Child prodigy">child prodigy</a>, starting college at the age of 11, and receiving his PhD at age 16. He is cold and calculating, and refrains from any form of physical contact if possible. Sheldon exhibits a strict adherence to routine to the point of exhibiting <a href="/wiki/Obsessive%E2%80%93compulsive_disorder" title="Obsessive–compulsive disorder">obsessive–compulsive disorder</a>, performing specific activities on specific days and specifics times, such as doing the laundry on Saturday night at 8:15. Any disruption to this routine distresses him enormously. A running gag has him always knocking on doors or other surfaces in a pattern of three knocks and one call repeated three times, which he has to complete no matter what. He has forced Leonard into signing an absurdly exhaustive "Roommate Agreement", and later enters a similar "Relationship Agreement" with Amy Farrah Fowler. Sheldon has great difficulty identifying sarcasm and irony and responding in kind, and a recurring topic is his efforts to acquire these skills. He has also enormous difficulties lying or even keeping a secret, giving himself away with wild facial tics and implausible statements. He is however fond of occasionally playing a prank, which he typically punctuates with his trademark exclamation "Bazinga!". Sheldon has a superiority complex and makes no effort to hide his contempt for other people's intellects, often making highly inappropriate comments. A common joke is his inability to drive, although he did receive a <a href="/wiki/Learner%27s_permit" title="Learner's permit">learner's permit</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-S02E05_3-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-S02E05-3"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup> Sheldon loves comic books and science fiction like his friends, but to the point of being obsessed about them, and is a fan of <a href="/wiki/Spock" title="Spock">Spock</a>, a fictional character of the <a href="/wiki/Star_Trek" title="Star Trek">Star Trek</a> franchise.<sup id="cite_ref-S02E21_4-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-S02E21-4"><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup> Unlike Leonard and Raj who come from intellectual families, Sheldon stands out from his own relatives. His father, George, whose death pre-dates the series, was described as a stereotypical Texan who liked <a href="/wiki/American_football" title="American football">football</a>, <a href="/wiki/Skeet_shooting" title="Skeet shooting">skeet shooting</a>, and heavy drinking,<sup id="cite_ref-S01E04_5-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-S01E04-5"><span>[</span>5<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-S03E07_6-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-S03E07-6"><span>[</span>6<span>]</span></a></sup> his mother, <a href="#Mary_Cooper">Mary</a>, is a devout Evangelical Christian, who does not possess anything near Sheldon's intellect (though she displays a great deal of common sense);<sup id="cite_ref-S03E01_7-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-S03E01-7"><span>[</span>7<span>]</span></a></sup> his <a href="/wiki/Fraternal_twin" title="Fraternal twin" class="mw-redirect">twin sister</a>, <a href="#Missy_Cooper">Missy</a>, and as-yet unseen brother, George Jr., were both described by Mary as being "dumb as soup". His fraternal twin sister who later has a baby boy makes Sheldon an uncle. He meets Amy Farrah Fowler in the Season 3 finale and starts a highly unusual and very slowly evolving relationship with her. Previous to this, he has also exhibited some affinities with Leonard's equally unemotional mother.</p>

<p>Penny (Her surname has not yet been revealed.) (<a href="/wiki/Kaley_Cuoco" title="Kaley Cuoco">Kaley Cuoco</a>), is Leonard and Sheldon's neighbor across the hallway. Originally from a small town outside <a href="/wiki/Omaha,_Nebraska" title="Omaha, Nebraska">Omaha, Nebraska</a>, she was a waitress and occasional bartender at the local <a href="/wiki/The_Cheesecake_Factory" title="The Cheesecake Factory">Cheesecake Factory</a> until season 7 and is an aspiring actress. Her educational qualifications (she had dropped out of <a href="/wiki/Community_college" title="Community college">community college</a>) are a constant source of disparaging comments from Sheldon. She has dated several men during the course of the series, including <a href="#Kurt">Kurt</a>, <a href="#Stuart">Stuart</a> and <a href="#Zack">Zack</a>, but her recurring love interest is Leonard. Leonard pursued Penny during season 1; they dated briefly at the start of season 2 which led to some awkwardness; they began dating again and were a couple for most of season 3 but she broke up with him after he told Penny he loved her and she was not ready to reciprocate. Penny and Leonard begin to date again "slowly" during the fifth season, though he does upset her by impulsively asking her to marry him during intercourse. She has a tense relationship with Sheldon, whose nerdy and obstinate personality often exasperate her, but they are ultimately good friends, helping each other out in various situations. By season four, Penny also begins to socialize more with Bernadette and Amy, who frequently hang out in Penny's apartment, go out together and comfort each other. Bernadette and Amy are both shown to be simultaneously envious of and threatened by Penny's more outgoing personality. Not much is known about Penny's family, but it is mentioned in the series that her father, Wyatt (portrayed by <a href="/wiki/Keith_Carradine" title="Keith Carradine">Keith Carradine</a><sup id="cite_ref-S04E9_8-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-S04E9-8"><span>[</span>8<span>]</span></a></sup>), raised her like a boy, her mother smoked marijuana while she was pregnant with her, her sister shot her husband while they were intoxicated and her brother is a <a href="/wiki/Methamphetamine" title="Methamphetamine">meth</a> addict. Cuoco began being credited as Kaley Cuoco-Sweeting, starting with the season seven episode, "<a href="/wiki/The_Big_Bang_Theory_(season_7)#ep149" title="The Big Bang Theory (season 7)">The Convention Conundrum</a>".</p>

<p>Howard Joel<sup id="cite_ref-S04E7_9-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-S04E7-9"><span>[</span>9<span>]</span></a></sup> Wolowitz (<a href="/wiki/Simon_Helberg" title="Simon Helberg">Simon Helberg</a>) is an aerospace engineer at Caltech's Department of <a href="/wiki/Applied_physics" title="Applied physics">Applied Physics</a> with a Masters in Engineering who often hangs out at Leonard and Sheldon's apartment. Unlike Sheldon, Leonard, and <a href="/wiki/Rajesh_Koothrappali" title="Rajesh Koothrappali" class="mw-redirect">Raj</a>, Howard has no doctorate, and often gets disparaged as a result, especially by Sheldon. He defends this by pointing out that he has a master's degree in Engineering from <a href="/wiki/Massachusetts_Institute_of_Technology" title="Massachusetts Institute of Technology">MIT</a> and that the equipment he designs is launched into space, unlike the theoretical work of his friends. In the season 5 finale, Howard goes to the <a href="/wiki/International_Space_Station" title="International Space Station">International Space Station</a> on <a href="/wiki/Expedition_31" title="Expedition 31">Expedition 31</a>. Howard lives in <a href="/wiki/Altadena" title="Altadena" class="mw-redirect">Altadena</a> with his domineering, belittling and unseen mother who treats him like a child. While he sometimes expresses irritation at this treatment, for the most part he appears to prefer it.<sup class="noprint Inline-Template" style="white-space:nowrap;">[<i><a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing_sources" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to the episode(s) in which it occurs (November 2011)">episode&#160;needed</span></a></i>]</sup> Howard dotes on his mother and participates in many of her daily routines. A recurring gimmick in the series is Howard and his mother communicating with each other from different rooms by yelling, a habit which Bernadette also adopts in later episodes. His father left them when he was eleven, and Howard gets visibly distressed when the subject comes up. Howard fancies himself a ladies' man and attempts <a href="/wiki/Pick-up_lines" title="Pick-up lines" class="mw-redirect">pick-up lines</a> whenever a woman is present, which often come off as inappropriate and disgusting, although he has dropped this habit since he started going out with Bernadette.<sup class="noprint Inline-Template" style="white-space:nowrap;">[<i><a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing_sources" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to the episode(s) in which it occurs (November 2011)">episode&#160;needed</span></a></i>]</sup> He is Jewish, but he is not very serious about his faith, and does not keep <a href="/wiki/Kosher" title="Kosher" class="mw-redirect">kosher</a>. For example, when the group's favorite Chinese restaurant raised the price of pork, Howard remarked, "It's getting tougher and tougher to be a bad Jew." However, he does observe <a href="/wiki/Shabbat" title="Shabbat">Sabbath</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Jewish_holidays" title="Jewish holidays">Jewish holidays</a>. In the pilot episode, it is shown that he is a <a href="/wiki/Polyglot" title="Polyglot" class="mw-redirect">polyglot</a> and can speak English, French, Mandarin, Russian, Arabic, and Farsi, along with fictional languages like <a href="/wiki/Klingon_language" title="Klingon language">Klingon</a> and <a href="/wiki/Sindarin" title="Sindarin">Sindarin</a>. He is asthmatic, allergic to peanuts, almonds and walnuts, prone to canker sores and pink eye, succumbs to seasickness, has an incredibly high genetic risk of heart illness, and has transient idiopathic arrhythmia. In Season 5 episode 4, it is shown that he knows <a href="/wiki/American_Sign_Language" title="American Sign Language">American Sign Language</a>. Howard dated Bernadette briefly in season 3. After some difficulties, they resumed their relationship in season 4, which culminated in their engagement. In the season 5 finale, Howard and Bernadette are married on the roof of the apartment building the day before he has to go into space.<sup id="cite_ref-S05E24_10-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-S05E24-10"><span>[</span>10<span>]</span></a></sup></p>

A recurring joke in the series is in reference to Bernadette and her lab team handling dangerous or infectious specimens, leading to accidental by-products or exposure to diseases. Instances include her trying to remember whether she washed her hands while she worked with penicillin-resistant gonorrhea or creating a cold medicine that may cause acidic tears. She is of Polish origin and Catholic upbringing, and is frequently seen wearing a cross necklace. Most notably, she is one of the only characters in the show who can control Sheldon, mostly because of her knowledge in dealing with stubborn children. She is generally a friendly and good-natured individual, quickly making friends with Penny and Amy, as well as the rest of the gang, but occasionally shows a darker side, most notably when she got into a fight with Amy over a parking space Sheldon and Howard were fighting over, and when she explains her interest in microbiology as being because she feels like a God to the bacteria she is studying.</p>
<p>Bernadette was first introduced to Howard by Penny after he invoked the "Girlfriend Pact". At first, she and Howard do not get along, as they appear to have nothing in common.

This makes Howard jealous, especially after the rest of his friends taunt him about his lack of a doctorate, and eventually leads to them having an argument after she purchases a <a href="/wiki/Rolex" title="Rolex">Rolex</a> watch for Howard, which he interprets as her "rubbing in" the fact that she now earns more than him.

She has a Ph.D. in neurobiology, with a research focus on addiction in primates and invertebrates, occasionally mentioning such experiments as getting a <a href="/wiki/Capuchin_monkey" title="Capuchin monkey">capuchin monkey</a> addicted to cigarettes or starfish addicted to <a href="/wiki/Cocaine" title="Cocaine">cocaine</a>. Raj and Howard found Amy through an online dating site after secretly setting up an account using Sheldon's name and information. The site matches her to Sheldon, and the two share many similar traits. Once she and Sheldon meet, she becomes, as Sheldon puts it, a girl who is his friend, but not his "girlfriend." They briefly ended their friendship when they got into an argument over whose field of study was superior.<sup id="cite_ref-S04E03_25-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-S04E03-25"><span>[</span>25<span>]</span></a></sup> The two initially communicate via computer, but at the encouragement of the group, she starts hanging out with the gang in person. Early on, Amy is, essentially, a female counterpart to Sheldon. During this time, she is almost coldly rational while displaying little emotion, is awkward in social situations ranging from endearing to embarrassing, is sometimes condescending towards those of lesser scientific knowledge and has little or no desire for physical intimacy. In Season Five, after Amy went out on a date with comic book store owner Stuart, Sheldon decided to solidify their relationship as boyfriend/girlfriend with a 31-page "Relationship Agreement". Amy began a campaign in "The Launch Acceleration" to increase Sheldon's feelings for her by becoming more involved in his interests like video games and Star Trek, and treating him as his mother had. During Howard and Bernadette's wedding ceremony, Amy is disappointed when Sheldon says that he hopes that the two of them are as happy together as he is alone.<sup id="cite_ref-S05E24_10-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-S05E24-10"><span>[</span>10<span>]</span></a></sup> Later as Howard is launched into space, Amy is surprised when Sheldon spontaneously takes her hand for comfort. Despite her best efforts, however, he repeatedly resists all of her attempts at persuading him to engage in physical intimacy though they are regularly holding hands at Amy's insistence at the beginning of season 6. By mid-season when Sheldon was caring for her when she had the flu, Sheldon has some intimate views of Amy pushing him further toward a normal relationship with her. She has also provided Sheldon with consoling hugs and was slapped on the rear by an intoxicated Sheldon, telling everyone that she is a great gal. Amy tried to move into his apartment when Leonard temporarily vacated it. After being prodded by Barry Kripke about his girlfriend, he lied that they were having sex, though he admitted to Penny that it might really happen between him and Amy and later admitted it to Amy while also engaging in <a href="/wiki/Dungeons_and_Dragons" title="Dungeons and Dragons" class="mw-redirect">Dungeons and Dragons</a>' intercourse gameplay. Nevertheless, her frustration is frequently played for laughs from that point onward. In the Season 7 episode "The Locomotive Manipulation", Sheldon sarcastically says he will give Amy the romance she wants, then he passionately kisses Amy on the lips for the first time.</p>
<p>While early on Amy was ambivalent and often condescending towards Penny and Bernadette, she later spends more time with them even at the expense of her time with Sheldon. As her appearances have progressed, she has shed her strident, aloof personality for a much more feminine and social one; although she retains some social awkwardness. Her feelings for Sheldon have also grown considerably over time and considers him to be ideal in almost every way, though she sometimes becomes as annoyed and frustrated by Sheldon's quirks as the others. Amy also intensely wants her relationship with Sheldon to progress to include sexual intimacy, a drastic departure from her early days as a member of her circle of friends. She has come to consider Penny a very close friend, sometimes referring to her as her "bestie," and, on another occasion, admitting her entire social life revolves around her. Penny herself is fond of Amy, on one occasion making an effort to salvage their friendship after she accidentally hurt her feelings. To her dismay, however, Amy often fails to grasp the concept of "girl talk," by talking about feminine hygiene and anatomy when in her presence and at times being brutally honest. Also, Amy often demonstrates an infatuation towards her, and occasionally Bernadette, to whom she is still rather condescending though still considers a close friend. These including making inappropriate comments about Penny's body and Bernadette's personality. When she feels that Leonard is interested in her, she admits to Penny that she has a better shot getting her into bed than Leonard. In episode 8 of the fifth season, she shows a disturbing enthusiasm on the whim that Bernadette's bridal shower should consist of naked bridesmaids washing each other, and she proposes that the bachelorette party consist of a Native American sweat lodge and women dancing around painting fertility symbols on the bride's naked body. Her more arrogant side is shown in "The Pulled Groin Extrapolation", where she is convinced that Leonard has fallen for her after he accompanies her to a friend's wedding and gives her a chaste kiss on the cheek, even though he has no such feelings. In "The Benefactor Factor", it is revealed that she is technically engaged to Saudi Arabian Prince Faisal who resides in Riyadh, who is the source of much of her lab's funding. Amy can also play the harp. In "The Scavenger Vortex," it is suggested that she attended <a href="/wiki/Harvard_University" title="Harvard University">Harvard University</a>.</p>

At Howard's bachelor party during the "The Stag Convergence" episode, Stuart uses his toasting turn to tell Howard how lucky he is by contrast to Stuart's own existence. In the Season 6 episode "The Bakersfield Expedition," Penny asks Stuart for advice about comics, and he sullenly answers, "Don't own a store that sells them."<sup id="cite_ref-30" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-30"><span>[</span>30<span>]</span></a></sup> During "The Decoupling Fluctuation", Stuart becomes close friends with Raj and starts hanging out with the gang as a replacement for Howard while Howard is in space. Before accepting this, Sheldon quizzed Stuart as to where he went to school (Stuart has an art degree). Sheldon concedes to allow Stuart to be in the group, calling him "fake-Wolowitz" and equating his past career choice in art to Howard's as an aerospace engineer as "equally ridiculous". When Howard returns from space Sheldon wants to dismiss Stuart from the group but Raj objects. Leonard tie-breaks on the basis that they are receiving a 20% discount in Stuart's store. Sheldon relents after Stuart offers to go as high as 30%. Initially, Sheldon had stipulated that Stuart must act like Howard while in the gang's presence.</p>

Amy is at first jealous until she sees Alex instead flirting with an unresponsive Leonard. Later, when Leonard admits his jealousy regarding a writing partner Penny is working with in a community college class, Alex attempts to flirt with him during the conversation, then again later in a text message. Leonard appears completely oblivious to her interest, however. In a later episode that season, Leonard finally realizes that Alex is making advances toward him. While proclaiming his undying loyalty to Penny, Leonard is flattered by Alex's interest to the point of giddiness. Alex's interest has occasionally gotten the guys into big trouble. For example, in the episode titled "The Egg Salad Equivalency", after Sheldon discovers that Alex has hit on Leonard, he tells Penny, Amy, and Bernadette about the situation going on between Alex and Leonard, which angers Penny because she is annoyed at how much Leonard enjoys Alex's attentions. Sheldon subsequently lectures Alex, which includes relating his late father's offensive joke comparing women to an egg salad sandwich. This only results in him getting called into Human Resources after Alex feels offended by the talk and makes a complaint. Eventually, Sheldon has to apologize to Alex and take a university-mandated online Sexual Harassment course. Sheldon then forces Alex to take the online course for him, due to him feeling his own time is too valuable to waste on it.<sup id="cite_ref-31" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-31"><span>[</span>31<span>]</span></a></sup> Alex scores some points with Sheldon after he sends her out to buy Amy a Valentine's Day gift, and Sheldon likes it so much that he keeps it for himself.<sup id="cite_ref-32" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-32"><span>[</span>32<span>]</span></a></sup></p>

Sheldon is shocked to discover that Kripke's work is more advanced than his own, and he tearfully admits as much to Amy. Kripke assumes that Sheldon is in a sexual relationship with Amy, and that has led to his work quality declining, and Sheldon does not deny it (although this appears to be just a convenient excuse since his work is inferior to Kripke's).

She has two other children besides Sheldon; Sheldon's twin sister, Missy and his brother George, who is shown via a family tree in "The Cruciferous Vegetable Amplification" to be three years older than Sheldon and Missy. To Mary's relief, her other children do not share Sheldon's hyper-intelligence, once commenting to Leonard "I thank the good Lord my other kids are as dumb as soup". She appeared in the fourth episode of the first season, the season three premiere, the third episode of season four, the sixth episode of season five and the eighteenth episode of season seven. Mary herself is not intellectual but is quite wise, though she is prone to making insensitive comments such as referring to "kung fu letters" when Leonard takes her to a sushi restaurant, or saying that "I thought it was <a href="/wiki/Indigenous_peoples_of_the_Americas" title="Indigenous peoples of the Americas"><i>our</i> Indians</a> that had the occasional drinking problem" when she sees Raj inebriated.

Having graduated at the top of her class at <a href="/wiki/University_of_Cambridge" title="University of Cambridge">Cambridge</a>, she is one of the lead attorneys at India's biggest car company. It is disclosed upon her first appearance in "The Irish Pub Formulation" episode that she and Leonard had a relationship five years earlier (without her parents' or Raj's knowledge) when she was in town, and that Leonard had been much more invested in the relationship than she. Leonard even offered to relocate to Delhi to be with her. He tries to keep their relationship a secret from the guys, but Sheldon discovers Priya in their apartment. Leonard eventually reveals to the rest of the guys that he has spent the night with Priya, as he is unable to bear the burden of keeping the secret.<sup id="cite_ref-43" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-43"><span>[</span>43<span>]</span></a></sup> Priya returns to Los Angeles for business in "The Cohabitation Formulation" and she and Leonard decide to try and have a real relationship, over the protests of Raj. It upsets Raj to know that his sister is having sex with one of his best friends (sometimes in Raj's bed). Priya soon becomes jealous of Penny and asks Leonard to stop spending time with her, but Leonard is unable to do so. Priya contests Sheldon's roommate agreement with Leonard, employing her legal background to deny Sheldon power over Leonard, but Sheldon drafts a new agreement. Sheldon then blackmails Leonard into signing it by threatening to tell Priya's parents she is dating Leonard, which she cannot bear because they want her to either date an Indian (although her father would accept her dating Howard due to his belief Jews are financially savvy and do not drink much). In the fourth season finale, it is revealed she is moving back to India and has not told Leonard, which Leonard interprets as the end of their relationship, leading him to expose their secret relationship to her parents. During Season 5, although they are separated, with Priya moving back a month earlier than expected, they nonetheless remain in-touch via webcam, having a cyber-dinner date/breakfast date. At Howard's suggestion, Leonard and Priya also attempt to simulate intercourse via webcam, but when it comes time for her to remove her clothing, Leonard's screen freezes up because of exceeding the bandwidth. Leonard later manages to get cue cards to help himself with a seduction speech to Priya, but while delivering it to her, he inadvertently reveals to her parents that they are cyber-dating (they were in the same room as she when he called), with them acidly asking for him to continue with the speech.<sup id="cite_ref-44" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-44"><span>[</span>44<span>]</span></a></sup> After Leonard tells Priya about his attraction to a comic book enthusiast named Alice, Priya admits to cheating on him with her former boyfriend, which visibly upsets Leonard.<sup id="cite_ref-45" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-45"><span>[</span>45<span>]</span></a></sup> She claims that it is not a competition, to which he replies that it is and that she won.

<p><a href="/wiki/Wil_Wheaton" title="Wil Wheaton">Wil Wheaton</a> (a fictionalized version of the real actor of that name): In the season three episode "<a href="/wiki/The_Big_Bang_Theory_(season_3)#ep45" title="The Big Bang Theory (season 3)">The Creepy Candy Coating Corollary</a>", Sheldon enters a trading card game tournament (<i>Mystic Warlords of Ka'a</i>) to confront Wil Wheaton over an incident that occurred in 1995 when Sheldon was devastated because Wheaton (<a href="/wiki/Wesley_Crusher" title="Wesley Crusher">Wesley Crusher</a> in <i><a href="/wiki/Star_Trek:_The_Next_Generation" title="Star Trek: The Next Generation">Star Trek: The Next Generation</a></i>) failed to show up at a fan convention that Sheldon took a 10-hour bus ride to attend (in which he had to "twice violate his personal rule of no relief on a moving vehicle"). In the final match, Sheldon is about to defeat his hated rival, but Wheaton tells Sheldon that the reason he missed the convention was because his grandmother had died. In sympathy, Sheldon deliberately messes up his next move in order to benefit Wheaton. Wheaton reveals that he lied about his grandmother, then wins the game by taking advantage of the opening Sheldon left him. Wil Wheaton makes a second appearance in the episode "<a href="/wiki/The_Big_Bang_Theory_(season_3)#ep59" title="The Big Bang Theory (season 3)">The Wheaton Recurrence</a>", where he uses <a href="/wiki/Gamesmanship" title="Gamesmanship">gamesmanship</a> again, breaking up Leonard and Penny's relationship in order to win a <a href="/wiki/Ten-pin_bowling" title="Ten-pin bowling">bowling</a> competition against the main characters. In "<a href="/wiki/The_Big_Bang_Theory_(season_4)#ep71" title="The Big Bang Theory (season 4)">The 21-Second Excitation</a>", Wheaton appears at a screening of <i><a href="/wiki/Raiders_of_the_Lost_Ark" title="Raiders of the Lost Ark">Raiders of the Lost Ark</a></i> and uses his celebrity status to go to the front of a long line. This antagonizes Sheldon, who derides him as the "<a href="/wiki/Jar_Jar_Binks" title="Jar Jar Binks">Jar Jar Binks</a> of the Star Trek universe." Wheaton and his entourage effectively prevent Sheldon and the guys from attending the screening when the last seat in the theater goes to the person directly in front of them in line. Ultimately, Sheldon steals the prints of the film and Wheaton leads a mob of angry <i>Raiders</i> fans after Sheldon. In the season five episode "<a href="/wiki/The_Big_Bang_Theory_(season_5)#ep92" title="The Big Bang Theory (season 5)">The Russian Rocket Reaction</a>", Wheaton appears to be genuinely sorry for his past actions and gives Sheldon a signed Wesley Crusher action figure as a way of thanking Sheldon for being a fan. His gesture is met with a renunciation of his "mortal enemy" status, and a hug from Sheldon. With Wheaton, <a href="/wiki/LeVar_Burton" title="LeVar Burton">LeVar Burton</a>, <a href="/wiki/Leonard_Nimoy" title="Leonard Nimoy">Leonard Nimoy</a>, <a href="/wiki/Brent_Spiner" title="Brent Spiner">Brent Spiner</a> and <a href="/wiki/George_Takei" title="George Takei">George Takei</a> also having appeared on the show, <i>Star Trek</i> is the most represented franchise on the show in terms of guest appearances.

In the season six episode "<a href="/wiki/The_Big_Bang_Theory_(season_6)#ep118" title="The Big Bang Theory (season 6)">The Habitation Configuration</a>", Wheaton appears in a <i>Star Trek</i>-themed episode of Sheldon's webseries <i>Fun with Flags</i>, and insults Sheldon's girlfriend (and the webisode's director), Amy. After he ditches Amy to hang out with Wheaton, Amy gets angry at Sheldon; he later unknowingly becomes inebriated and tries to start a fistfight with Wheaton, demanding an apology.</p>

Mrs. Wolowitz's raspy voice is heard usually in scenes at her house, which she shares with Howard. She talks to Howard always by yelling at him from another room, which results in awkward conversations with Howard yelling back at her. In an early episode, when the guys hear her yelling in a masculine voice, they ask Howard if that was his father, to which Howard replies "If she grows any more hair on her face, yes".</p>
<p>She is also described as being enormously obese (especially in the arms), and wearing a wig and painted-on eyebrows. Mrs. Wolowitz seems to be oblivious about Howard's work as an engineer and treats him like he is still a child. She frequently refers to Leonard, Sheldon, and Raj as Howard's "little friends" (as in, "I made some cookies and Hawaiian Punch for you and your little friends!") and often refers to Caltech as a "school". Howard often makes references to his mother as being a "crazy old lady", but deep down, he is deeply attached to his mother and quite happy to be treated like a child. However, in one episode, Howard attempts to move out after a fight with his mother, but has serious delusions that she is trying to force him to stay, when in actuality, she is urging him to move out, which leads to him staying. In the penultimate episode of season 4, she wants to "play doctor" with Raj when he asks to sleep over.</p>
<p>When Howard reveals that he has proposed to Bernadette and she has accepted, she collapses, causing Howard to panic (and dislocate his shoulder while trying to barge into the bathroom to help her). The timing leads him to believe that she may not like Bernadette (who is Catholic) and has suffered a heart attack from the shock of the news. In actuality, her fainting was due to food poisoning from the food she ate while meeting Bernadette, and was completely unrelated to Howard's news. She has graciously accepted Bernadette as her future daughter-in-law and loves that she is a doctor. She attended Howard and Bernadette's wedding on Leonard/Sheldon/Penny's apartment building roof and can be seen in the satellite picture of the event.<sup id="cite_ref-S05E24_10-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-S05E24-10"><span>[</span>10<span>]</span></a></sup> The episode "The Spoiler Alert Segmentation" is a major episode in Mrs. Wolowitz's character as she appears on screen for the first time; first walking across the kitchen through the kitchen doors, and then her hands are seen pulling Raj back into the house. Her face is not seen at all, but her appearances in the kitchen scene make her out to be an extremely obese woman.</p>
<p>It is often implied that the relationship between Howard and his mother comes close to that of <a href="/wiki/Norman_Bates" title="Norman Bates">Norman Bates</a> and <a href="/wiki/Norma_Bates_(Psycho)" title="Norma Bates (Psycho)">his mother</a> from the film <i><a href="/wiki/Psycho_(1960_film)" title="Psycho (1960 film)">Psycho</a></i>.

Unlike Penny's other boyfriends, he considers Leonard, Howard, Sheldon, and Raj (whom he calls "the science guys") to be "cool" and makes a genuine effort to get to know them, considering them to be his friends.

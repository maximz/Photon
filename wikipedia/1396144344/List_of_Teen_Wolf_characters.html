Tyler Posey portrays Scott McCall.</div>
</div>
</div>
<p><b>Scott McCall</b>, portrayed by <a href="/wiki/Tyler_Posey" title="Tyler Posey">Tyler Posey</a>, is the main protagonist of the series. Scott is bitten by Alpha werewolf, Peter Hale, which transforms him into a <a href="/wiki/Werewolf" title="Werewolf">werewolf</a>. Using his new supernatural abilities, he becomes the co-captain of his high-school <a href="/wiki/Lacrosse" title="Lacrosse">lacrosse</a> team. He begins a relationship with Allison Argent, who he later discovers to be part of a werewolf-hunter family. Throughout season 1, with the help of his best friend, Stiles Stilinski, and a mysterious werewolf, Derek Hale, Scott struggles to control his transformations, balance his high school life with being a newly turned werewolf and keep his loved ones safe from the complications and dangers his new life presents. He gains success controlling his transformations using thoughts of Allison as an anchor to his humanity, realizing he is in love with her. Originally, seeing his new status as a werewolf as a curse, Scott wished to find a cure, but by the end of season 2, after Allison and his mother, Melissa accept his new life, he has accepted his werewolf powers and abilities as a gift to defend and save people. Throughout seasons 2 and 3, Scott is an Omega werewolf, but to combat the supernatural threats he is, on occasion, a Beta in Derek's pack. In the season 3 premiere, Scott gets a tattoo of two bands around his left upper arm with Derek's help. He sees the mark as a reward for having let Allison go in the season 2 finale. In the episode "Currents", Deaton confirms that Scott has the potential to become a "True Alpha", a rare werewolf that can gain the Alpha status purely by strength of character, by willpower rather than by dominance, conquest or killing – such an Alpha is the rarest of all werewolves. In the episode "Alpha Pact", Scott temporarily sacrifices himself with Stiles and Allison through a druid ritual to save their parents from being sacrificed as Guardians for the Darach, Jennifer Blake. He used the watch his father gave to his mother, describing it as "the only part of their marriage that worked" as his key to take his mother's place as a Guardian, with Deaton as his tether. In the season 3 finale "Lunar Ellipse", Scott and Derek along with Deucalion defeat the Darach, and Scott fully awakens his True Alpha status and abilities and saves his mother and his friends' parents. As a result of his sacrifice, Scott now carries the burden of having a darkness around his heart like a tattoo. In the season 3B premiere, "Anchors", Scott suffers from hallucinations regarding his new Alpha werewolf form and experiences lapses in control of his transformations due to his druid sacrifice. With the help of Ethan and Aiden, and following his mother's advice to "be (his) own anchor", Scott regains control of his transformation and gains the ability to force other shapeshifters to transform with a powerful roar, having Malia Tate revert to human form after eight years trapped as a werecoyote. Scott begins a new romance with new student Kira Yukimura after learning she likes him and she is also supernatural, a kitsune. When it's determined Stiles is possessed by the Nogitsune, Scott is determined throughout season 3B to separate the dark kitsune spirit from his best friend without Stiles dying. In "De-Void", Scott and Kira affirm their feelings for each other when she stays the night with him after learning her mother's secrets and they kiss. Scott is shown by Peter how to utilize an Alpha's power to <a href="/wiki/Telepathy" title="Telepathy">access someone's mind</a> through his claws, which he does and enters Stiles' mind with Lydia. Lydia reminds Scott that Stiles is a part of his "pack". Realizing this, Scott uses his Alpha roar on Stiles, allowing the latter to break free of the Nogitsune. In "Insatiable", Scott pieces together the clues to Lydia's location, Camp Oak Creek, from the banshee, Meredith Walker. He and Stiles manage to find and rescue Lydia, who states that she warned them not come looking for her. Scott rushes back the gates of Oak Creek, only to find Allison has been fatally stabbed by the Oni, which are now controlled by the Nogitsune. He can't take away her pain and is fearfully in denial. Allison comforts him saying she loves him and is in his arms, saying it's perfect. Allison dies. Scott tearfully kisses her forehead. In the season 3B finale, "The Divine Move", he, Kira, Stiles and Lydia make a final stand against the Nogitsune at the school. They are caught in what is identified by Stiles, as an illusion of the state between life and death, Bardo. Scott and Kira fight the Oni with all their might. As the latter prepares to kill Stiles, Lydia and Kira, the dark kitsune is distracted by the knowledge they gained from the Shugendō scroll, to change the host's body. Scott surprises the demon and Bites it on the arm, as the creature can't be both a fox and a wolf and the Nogitsune is defeated and re-imprisoned by Isaac. Scott moves on with his life grieving Allison's death, teaching Malia, who has joined his pack, how to control her shapeshifter abilities.</p>
<p>Scott is extremely protective and caring of those he loves, particularly Allison, his best friend, Stiles whom he is closest to and considers a brother and his mother, Melissa. Scott is good natured, determined, sharp-witted and has a very clear sense of right and wrong, but he can let his emotions get the best of him. He sees his new werewolf status and powers as ways to help and protect people and doesn't believe in outright destroying his opponents. Scott lives with his mother, Melissa, who works as a hospital nurse. She and Scott are closer in season 3 after she finds out and accepts that Scott is a werewolf. Scott has deep feelings for Allison. He first meets Allison on her first day at high school and they start a romantic relationship in season 1, but in episode "Night School" of season 1 Allison breaks up with Scott due to the fact that he is lying to her because of the supernatural threats. In the season one finale, Scott and Allison get back together after she finds out he is a werewolf and realizes he was only lying to her for her own good. In season 2, they are very much in love, but they keep their relationship secret as Allison's parents forbade them from seeing each other again. Later on, Scott is horrified by Allison's behavior because of Gerard's manipulation and her mother's death. After Allison apologizes for her amoral actions, they break up because Allison needs space, but in season 3, he and Allison still care for each other. Scott and Isaac at first did not have a good relationship, not trusting each other. Nevertheless, they become good friends after realizing that they both have good intentions. Isaac helps Scott defeat Gerard and save Jackson in the season 2 finale. In season 3, they become closer, with Isaac now living at Scott's house. Later on, Scott is hurt that Allison and Isaac have developed romantic feelings for each other, but he is not angry with either of them. Scott is good friends with Lydia Martin. Back in season 1 she was originally attracted to him for his improvement at lacrosse and kissed him at one point when Scott was under the influence of the full moon. Their friendship is cemented in season 3 episode "The Girl Who Knew Too Much" when they make a shared vow to use their shared supernatural status (werewolf and banshee) to save lives. Scott also has a healthy relationship with his employer, Alan Deaton, the veterinarian of Beacon Hills. Alan acts as a father to Scott, and a mentor, providing Scott with counsel amongst the supernatural threats and now functions as a druid emissary to Scott after he becomes a True Alpha werewolf.</p>
<p>Scott has a tumultuous relationship with fellow werewolf Derek Hale. Scott asks for his help in controlling his new werewolf powers and abilities, and later for a cure, but overtime sees Derek as a bully, cynical and that Derek always resorts to violence to solve problems. In season 2, Scott stops trusting Derek after he gains his Alpha status by killing Peter and disapproves of Derek's attempt to build his pack giving the Bite to fellow outcast students, but they grudgingly work together to stop the Kanima. By season 3, Scott still does not always agree with Derek's ways of dealing with threats, but he relates with Derek admitting there are situations where you can't save those you care for without killing your enemies as he was willing to kill Jennifer Blake to stop her from sacrificing his mother. Ultimately, Scott and Derek see each other as friends. Scott's biological father, Rafael, is an FBI field agent and is divorced from his mother. Rafael is not seen until halfway through the third season. Rafael is a deadbeat parent. He and Scott have rather frosty confrontations showing Scott is by no means on good terms with Rafael for his leaving him and Melissa.</p>
<p>Scott possesses all of the powers, abilities, and weaknesses of an Alpha werewolf.</p>
<p>"Teen Wolf: The Hunt", a Teen Wolf inspired <a href="/wiki/Social_network" title="Social network">social network</a> game for <a href="/wiki/Facebook" title="Facebook">Facebook</a>, states that Scott was born on August 23. He likes guitars, horror films, and skateboarding, and is a fan of <a href="/wiki/The_Black_Lips" title="The Black Lips" class="mw-redirect">The Black Lips</a>, <a href="/wiki/Kids_of_88" title="Kids of 88">Kids of 88</a>, <a href="/wiki/Blink-182" title="Blink-182">Blink-182</a>, and Lost in Kostko (Tyler Posey's band in real life, in which he plays guitar and sings lead vocals).</p>

Crystal Reed portrays Allison Argent</div>
</div>
</div>
<p><b>Allison Argent</b>, portrayed by <a href="/wiki/Crystal_Reed" title="Crystal Reed">Crystal Reed</a>, was Scott McCall's first love, and a member of the Argent family, a long line of werewolf hunters. She was best friends with Lydia Martin, friends with Jackson Whittemore, Stiles Stilinski and Kira Yukimura, and the girlfriend of werewolf Isaac Lahey. Allison was killed by the Oni, controlled by the Nogitsune, in episode 23 of season 3, "Insatiable".</p>
<p>In the pilot, "Wolf Moon", Allison meets Scott McCall on her first day of school. They begin a romantic relationship. She is at first unaware of Scott and Derek's lives as werewolves, and her family's werewolf-hunter life. Her aunt Kate reveals the supernatural world to her in "Co-Captain" as well as her family's werewolf-hunter life. In the season 1 episode "Formality", she is shaken after the revelation, but she decides to be strong. She is shocked even further when it's revealed Scott is a werewolf at the school formal. In the season 1 finale, "Code Breaker" she confronts Scott over his lies, but later Allison learns of what Kate truly is, she sees Peter Hale, the Alpha werewolf kill Kate as revenge for the Hale fire and helps to defeat Peter. Realizing that Scott's dishonesty was to protect her, Allison kisses Scott and tells him she loves him. In season 2, Scott and Allison are shown to be in love, but carry on their romance in secret after her father threatens Scott to have him stay away from Allison and she promises to never see Scott again. Her grandfather, Gerard, decides that it is time she be trained to be an official hunter, which in her case means being groomed to eventually succeed her mother as the family's leader. She helps Scott and Stiles deal with Derek's pack, and later, the Kanima and its mysterious Master. Allison is devastated in "Party Guessed", when she learns from her father at the hospital that her mother Victoria is dead. She is later corrupted by Gerard, who emotionally uses Victoria's suicide to use her to attack and kill Derek's pack, straining her relationships with her friends and Chris becomes horrified by the person she's becoming. She comes close to murdering Erica and Boyd, but her father shoots her bow out of her hand saving their lives. In the season 2 finale, when Gerard holds her captive with the Kanima so he can force Scott to have a paralyzed Derek bite him to cure his cancer, she soon realizes what her grandfather is, and her mistake. After the threats of season 2 pass, Allison, saddened by the death of her mother and feeling guilty over her actions breaks up with Scott. Scott accepts this. Allison also reconciles with her father, after all they've lost.</p>
<p>At the start of season 3, Allison has had no contact with Scott whatsoever in the four months following the final encounter with the Kanima, having spent the summer at her family's ancestral home in France. She and Chris agreed to lay their family legacy aside and return to Beacon Hills to start a real, normal life. Although she and Scott are no longer together, it is evident that she still cares deeply for him. She is cold towards Derek because of his part in her mother's death. She saves Scott and Derek from an out of control Boyd and Cora, but at the cost of setting them loose. Angered, Derek confronts her, eventually having Scott reveal to her that her mother tried to murder Scott back in season 2 which is why Derek bit her, to save Scott which led to her suicide. Allison accepts this. In violation of her agreement with her father, she begins to help Scott and Derek's pack fight against the Alpha pack. Allison and Isaac also mend fences as she attacked him during her moral spiral, so much so that they partner up to deal with the current situation and they develop feelings for each other. Isaac is chosen as her tether when she has to undertake a dangerous ritual to save her missing father from being sacrificed by Jennifer Blake, the Darach. She uses an actual <i>silver</i> bullet of her father's, as part of his allegiance to the Argents' hunter code, to use as her key to take her father's place as he is a 'Guardian' to her. Deaton warns her along with Scott and Stiles that sacrificing themselves, temporarily, with have lasting mental effects on them, having darkness around her heart, like a "scar".</p>
<p>In the mid-season 3 finale, Allison, with help from Isaac, find the parents in the root cellar just before Jennifer sacrifices them. In response to the Nemeton's activation, Allison convinces her father to bring both of them out of retirement, accepts her role as leader of the family and states a new code: "Nous protégeons ceux qui ne peuvent pas se protéger eux-mêmes", which is "we protect those who cannot protect themselves" in English. In "Anchors", as a result of her druid sacrificial ritual, Allison suffers from hallucinations seeing visions of her dead aunt Kate and suffers from trembling which has been interfering with her motor and archery skills; during one of her visions she fires an arrow at a threatening visage of Kate, but had actually fired the arrow at Lydia in reality, but Isaac catches the arrow in time saving Lydia's life. After remembering her and her father's new code, Allison regains her confidence and sharp-shooting skills, saving the werecoyote, Malia Tate's life by firing a tranquilizer dart at Mr. Tate. She still cares for Scott and appear slightly hurt, but shows acceptance when he starts a relationship with Kira Yukimura. Allison also starts acting on her feelings for Isaac, flirting with him, dancing with him at Danny's black light party and kissing him as an act of encouragement when they accompany her father to uncover information on the Oni. Isaac is electrified and induced into a coma by a trap set by off the Nogitsune saving her life. In "The Fox and the Wolf", Allison suffers a minor breakdown from all the pressure on her shoulders, confessing to Stilinski she seems to always feel scared due to the dangers and she's conflicted over her feelings with Scott and Isaac, the latter she thinks could be dying. In "De-Void", to her relief, Isaac recovers and spends the night with her. With Kira's help, she keeps Isaac, and Ethan and Aiden at bay when it's realized they are under the Nogitsune's control. After Lydia is kidnapped by the Nogitsune in "Insatiable", Allison sets out to search for her with Isaac. She learns Isaac was still himself when he slept with her before the Nogitsune's fly took control. In the meantime, her father finally teaches her how to make her own silver bullet. She opts to make a silver arrowhead instead, since the bow and arrow are her weapons. She tells her father she loves him and is proud of what they've done. At Eichen house, the Nogitsune gains control of the Oni and turns them against Kira, Isaac, and Allison. During the fight, Isaac is severely mauled by the Oni and one of the demons is about to kill him. Allison draws her final arrow, her silver arrowhead and fires it into the Oni, destroying the demon entity and saving Issac's life; unfortunately another Oni runs her through with its sword. She collapses into Scott's arms. Scott tells her that Lydia is safe. Dying, she comforts a horrified Scott, telling him it's okay, that she is in his arms, he was her first love and she will love him forever and he has to tell her dad. Allison then passes away.</p>
<p>In "The Divine Move", Isaac figures out that what Allison wanted Scott to tell her father was that she had figured out the way to kill the Oni. She had remembered the way Chris had been able to slow down an Oni by shattering its mask when he shot it with a silver bullet. Allison believed that silver was the key to defeating an Oni but that Chris's bullet had continued to fly which was what had saved the Oni but that an arrow would remain in the body, poisoning the demon and killing it. Chris and Isaac discovers that Allison had left four arrow heads behind and they use them to defeat the Oni and avenge Allison.</p>
<p>Allison is naturally caring, sweet, charming, strong-minded and loyal to her friends and family, going to great lengths to protect them. When she learns of her family's hunter life, she realizes the hunters are to protect humanity from the supernatural, but she occasionally shows disgust and anger towards some of her family's sometimes ruthless methods. Her best friend is Lydia Martin and she is deeply in love with Scott McCall, disobeying her father, Chris' violent demand that she break up with him. However, after she was corrupted by Gerard in season 2, using the death of her mother (unaware that Victoria had tried to murder Scott which led to her suicide) to entice her to hunt down Derek, she temporarily changed becoming reminiscent of her aunt Kate: sadistic, bloodthirsty and threatening, even to Scott. Though after the events of "Master Plan", after Gerard threatened her life, she showed genuine sadness, guilt and remorse for the horrible things she did. Allison has a natural talent for <a href="/wiki/Archery" title="Archery">archery</a> and is an accomplished gymnast. In season 2, Chris started her training to be a werewolf hunter. Allison has shown skills in hand-to-hand combat, wiring vehicles, stitching open wounds, stealthily hunting and corralling werewolves and weaponry such as Chinese ring daggers, disarming foes with a chain, as well as her archery skills. "Teen Wolf: The Hunt", a Teen Wolf inspired social network game, states that Allison was born on March 19 in <a href="/wiki/Elkhorn,_Wisconsin" title="Elkhorn, Wisconsin">Elkhorn, Wisconsin</a>. She likes archery, running, and <a href="/wiki/Unicef" title="Unicef" class="mw-redirect">Unicef</a>, and is a fan of <a href="/wiki/Karmin" title="Karmin">Karmin</a>, <a href="/wiki/Arcade_Fire" title="Arcade Fire">Arcade Fire</a>, <a href="/wiki/Florence_and_the_Machine" title="Florence and the Machine">Florence and the Machine</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Vampire_Weekend" title="Vampire Weekend">Vampire Weekend</a>.</p>

Dylan O'Brien portrays Stiles Stilinski.</div>
</div>
</div>
<p><b>Stiles Stilinski</b>, portrayed by <a href="/wiki/Dylan_O%27Brien" title="Dylan O'Brien">Dylan O'Brien</a>, is Scott's best friend. He is quick witted and comical. He is shown to be intelligent and clever, if somewhat impractical about things. His intelligence is shown very early on when he figures out that Scott is becoming a werewolf and helps him adapt to his new supernatural life. He is Scott's sidekick and confidant, helping the young werewolf deal with the numerous threats that plague the town. The show alludes to him having <a href="/wiki/Attention_deficit_hyperactivity_disorder" title="Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder">attention deficit hyperactivity disorder</a> through references to his <a href="/wiki/Adderall" title="Adderall">Adderall</a> use, which lends to his fidgeting gestures and frequent flailing.<sup id="cite_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup> Stiles often provides <a href="/wiki/Comic_relief" title="Comic relief">comic relief</a> to the otherwise dramatic events surrounding him and Scott. His eagerness to help and his caring nature have put him in dangerous situations. "Stiles" is not his first name; creator <a href="/wiki/Jeff_Davis_(writer)" title="Jeff Davis (writer)">Jeff Davis</a> has stated that Stiles' real name hasn't been revealed. It is canon that Stiles' first name was his maternal grandfather's name.</p>
<p>Stiles, throughout season 1 and 2, has an unrequited love for Lydia Martin, having harbored a crush on her since the third grade. Stiles also shares a close relationship with his father, Sheriff Stilinski. His mother, Claudia died when he was 9 years old and it's revealed Stiles was with her at the time of her death. She suffered from <a href="/wiki/Frontotemporal_dementia" title="Frontotemporal dementia">frontotemporal dementia</a>. He is shown to be insecure about his mother and her death, blaming himself for it and thinking it may come between him and his father. Stiles suffered from panic attacks after his mother's death. He also wishes to keep his father out of the supernatural occurrences for fear that telling him could involve him too deeply and/or get him killed. He wishes he could help and protect his father in some way, feeling he can't because he does not have training or supernatural abilities. Stiles has a simultaneously adversarial and allied relationship with werewolf Derek Hale. Stiles stands up to Derek, and sometimes Derek scares him into submission, but sometimes he allows Stiles to do so. They help each other out and save each other's lives multiple times, and by season 3, they are reluctant allies. In Season 3, Stiles is shown to be working with Lydia to figure out who is the culprit behind the mysterious sacrifices going on in Beacon Hills. They have a more equal, platonic dynamic that suggests Stiles' love for her has become less intense. In "Alpha Pact", when Stiles, already excessively worried over his father after Jennifer Blake, the Darach abducted him, receives word Jennifer has all three parents for the final sacrifice, Guardians, he suffers a panic attack. Lydia helps him snap out of it by kissing him. He eventually sacrifices himself temporarily along with Scott and Allison to save their parents with Lydia as his tether and his father's Sheriff badge as his key to taking his father's place as a Guardian. He is finally reunited with his father at the end of the mid-season finale "Lunar Ellipse", with the new burden of having a "darkness" forever shrouding his heart, like a tattoo. As a result of the druid sacrifice, in "Anchors", Stiles begins hallucinating, suffering from sleep paralysis and partial dyslexia. Later, after being reassured by Lydia of his skills of deciphering puzzles without instructions and helping his father reunite Malia Tate with her father, Stiles regains his confidence and his dyslexia is cured. However, after the William Barrow situation and Danny's blacklight party, Stiles figures out that he was supposedly the one who left the coded message on the chemistry lab blackboard for Barrow to kill Kira Yukimura. In the episode "Silverfinger", Stiles is revealed to be possessed by the Nogitsune/Void, the newest threat, that draws power from individuals marked with pain, strife, tragedy as he/it refused to be "tagged" by the Oni and destroys three out of the five. In "Riddled", in his sleepwalking, he sees himself and the Nogitsune's spiritual form in a basement that has the Japanese kanji (己) carved on a wall. The dark kitsune spirit communicates with Stiles in his visions asking the riddle, "Everyone has it, but no one can lose it", which Stiles, terrified, eventually solves as a "shadow". Stiles comes to the realization he's possessed by the Nogitsune, when the demon assumes his very face. Under the Nogitsune's control, Stiles sets off a series of traps which leaves innocents injured and dead, including Isaac being induced into a coma, but the Nogitsune's hold over Stiles is temporarily broken when Deaton poisons Stiles with a shot of letharia vulpina or 'wolf lichen'.</p>
<p>In "Echo House", Stiles with the realization he is dangerous and to prevent the Nogitsune from harming anyone else, he has himself institutionalized at Eichen House. He succeeds in keeping the Nogitsune from getting back into his head by keeping himself awake with amphetamines provided by Marin Morrell. He sees that Malia Tate is also interned there. He is shown around by his roommate, Oliver who's there for trepidation and is nightly held by a "five-point restraint system". Stiles gains suspicions regarding a fellow intern, Meredith Walker. Stiles also recognizes the basement as the same one from his dream. With Malia's help, Stiles gets into the basement. Stiles explains his situation to Malia where they bond over their horrific dilemmas. Eventually they kiss and proceed to have sex. Behind the hollow wall, they find the Nogitsune's physical body, but are caught by Oliver who knocks Malia out and binds Stiles with the same system used on him at night. The Nogitsune had managed to get into Oliver's head. Stiles gives up his fight with the Nogitsune, lets the dark spirit back in so that he will spare Malia's life. In "De-Void", Void Stiles tricks Allison, Derek, Sheriff Stilinski and Chris into coming to Derek's loft to protect him from the Oni. During the attack, Void Stiles returns to Eichen House and confronts Kira's mother, Noshiko, about why she carved the kanji for “Self” into the wall. She says to signify that her former love interest, Rhys, died as himself and not as the Nogitsune. Void Stiles asks what happened to the Noshiko who called out for chaos, strife, and pain to descend upon everyone and everything. Noshiko says she doesn’t want that anymore. Void Stiles counters that it does and snatches away her dagger, her last “tail,” and cuts into Stiles's stomach, unleashes a swarm of flies that proceed to possess all the werewolves in Beacon Hills to exact vengeance. Stiles is later found unconscious by Lydia and Aiden and is taken to Scott's house. After choking Aiden, Void Stiles is paralyzed with Kanima venom provided by Dr. Deaton. With assistance from Lydia and Peter, Scott enters Void Stiles's mind and finally manages to separate Stiles from the Nogitsune, which has taken Stiles's appearance and disappeared with Lydia. In "Insatiable", at his own request, he has Noshiko summon two of her Oni near him to make sure he is fully cured. They "tag" him successfully. After embracing his father, Stiles goes to Eichen House to find Meredith Walker, whom he suspects is a banshee like Lydia. Despite being free of the Nogitsune, Stiles is shown to be in constant internal pain and freezing. After they are informed of Lydia's current location at Oak Creek, they rush to save her. Stiles lets Scott know he doesn't care if he dies, because of all the things he did under the Nogitsune's control, nobody is going to die because of him.

Tyler Hoechlin portrays Derek Hale.</div>
</div>
</div>
<p><b>Derek Hale</b>, portrayed by <a href="/wiki/Tyler_Hoechlin" title="Tyler Hoechlin">Tyler Hoechlin</a>, is a werewolf by birth. He lived in Beacon Hills with his family, a pack of both werewolves and humans. When he was 15 years old, he fell in love with a girl named Paige. Wanting to be with her forever, Derek, with some manipulative persuasion from his uncle Peter, comes up with the idea of turning her into a werewolf. Peter asks Ennis, an Alpha werewolf, to give her the Bite. After Ennis bites her, Derek, hearing Paige's painful screams, changes his mind, attacks Ennis and realizes he is too late to save Paige. Knowing that she will die instead of transforming, Derek breaks her spine to end her suffering. The killing of an innocent causes his werewolf eyes to change from yellow to blue, darkening his soul.</p>
<p>Later on, he entered into a sexual relationship with Kate Argent, unaware she was a werewolf-hunter and was only using him to get information on his family. With a group of conspirators and arsonists, Kate burns the Hale House down, killing most of Derek's family and his uncle Peter is rendered comatose. Derek and his older sister Laura were away from the house at school at the time. They received the insurance money for the fire and left Beacon Hills for New York. Due to his tragic experiences, Derek turned dark, cynical, angry, and mistrustful; Peter claims that Derek's best ally has always been anger because he lacks a heart.</p>
<p>Derek returns to Beacon Hills six years after the fire to investigate a mysterious Alpha werewolf that had bitten Scott McCall and had killed Laura. He attempts to train Scott to control his new werewolf nature. He disapproves of Scott's relationship with Allison Argent, due to her werewolf-hunter family and his previous experiences with Kate. He does not immediately get along with Stiles, and tends to bully him into participating in his plans by threats and intimidation. However, after saving each other's lives multiple times, by the mid-Season 3 finale the two have become reluctant allies, and Derek humors Stiles and somewhat trusts his judgement. Derek is close to Cora, his younger sister; he thought she died in the Hale House Fire and was shocked when he discovered she was alive. Derek cares about Cora, he is protective of her, and actually cares about what she thinks of him, even though he is not as close to Cora as he used to be. Derek had a good relationship with his uncle Peter, until he finds out from Scott that Peter purposefully killed his sister Laura to become the new Alpha.</p>
<p>In the Season 1 finale, Derek becomes the new Alpha werewolf, after killing Peter to avenge Laura's death. As an Alpha werewolf, Derek exhibits pride. He attempts to recruit Scott into his pack, but is rebuked as Scott doesn't trust him. He goes on to bite three students from Beacon Hills High, Isaac Lahey, Erica Reyes and Vernon Boyd, all with dark histories, recruiting them to his pack. He is threatened by the Kanima and sets out to kill it. As the events escalate, Erica and Boyd leave, frightened of the Argent werewolf genocide. He grows to respect Scott more over time, treating him as more of an equal, but his hostility towards Allison only increases, as she becomes a werewolf hunter and attacks him and his pack.</p>
<p>In Season 3, an Alpha pack, lead by the fearsome Alpha Deucalion arrives in Beacon Hills ostensibly to recruit Derek, and are holding Boyd and Erica. Derek is saddened when Erica is found dead, but is emotionally shaken when he discovers that his younger sister Cora survived the fire that killed the rest of his family. He saves Jennifer Blake, the new English teacher, from a feral Boyd and Cora, and connects with her, starting a relationship with her. However Jennifer betrays him, as it turned out she is the Darach, a powerful corrupted druid who is making human sacrifices and poisons Cora with <a href="/wiki/Mistletoe" title="Mistletoe">mistletoe</a> for leverage against him. He leaves town with Cora after losing two members of his pack (Erica and Boyd), giving up his Alpha status in order to save her from death, helping Scott save the kidnapped parents and defeating Jennifer. At the beginning of Season 3.5, Derek is on a mission in South America to retrieve his mother Talia's claws, (all that was left of her after the Hale fire) which are in the possession of a clan of Hispanic hunters. He and Cora are also separated, presumably because he had her go into hiding. Unfortunately, he and Peter are captured by the hunters, and tortured for information about "the she-wolf". They are rescued by Braeden, who was hired by Deucalion to save them. After retrieving Talia's claws and returning to Beacon Hills, Derek has Peter stab the claws into the back of his neck to ask his mother a question utilizing a ritual to channel Talia's spirit. After Stiles is found after sleepwalking and he is being run for tests of the same disease that killed his mother, Derek provides comfort to Scott and reveals to Scott that Talia had told him the Hales didn't only live in Beacon Hills, they protected the town and it still needs someone like Scott needs to continue protecting it from harm. Derek and Chris are arrested under suspicion of murdering the mobster Katashi and are detained at the Sheriff's station where a bomb has been placed, all arranged by the Nogitsune. Derek saves Chris' life when the bomb goes off. In "De-Void", the Nogitsune arranges for one of its flies to enter Derek and possess him. While possessed, he overpowers Chris, ties him up and sprays him with liter fluid. He confronts Chris over the fact he's a hunter, that Kate burned his family to death asking him how many werewolves he has killed. He . Chris manages to break free and holds Derek at gunpoint until the effects of the Nogitsune's fly wears off, returning him to normal. In "Insatiable", Derek confronts Chris over why he didn't shoot Derek when he was controlled by the Nogitsune. Chris says Derek is not his enemy anymore. He saves the twins from unknown assailants and hides them inside the werecoyote's den. He sees that they have been shot with wolfsbane-laced bullets, and is later assisted by Chris as he takes the twins back to his loft. In the season 3.5 finale, Derek is first shown healing the twins' gunshot wounds. After they consider going into hiding with Lydia and Danny, Derek explains to them that if they really want to join Scott's pack, they should fight for his cause of protecting people instead of just fighting for him. He, along with the twins, confront the Nogitsune to seal it away inside the Nemeton jar which held Talia's claws. Taunted by the Nogitsune of the lack of their former Alpha statuses, Derek assures it he could still fight like an Alpha. After a prolonged fight with the Nogitsune-controlled Oni, Derek and the twins are saved by Chris, who begins to destroy the Oni with Allison's silver-tipped arrows. After Aiden sacrifices himself to kill the last Oni, Derek holds him in his arms and promises to tell Lydia how he became a good guy. Derek is later seen with Stiles in the locker room at school recounting a “dream” he had or thinks he had. In it, the Spanish speaking hunters had tracked him to his loft and were once again demanding information about “La loba”. Derek says he’ll never tell them where Cora has gone but they’re not talking about Cora. At that moment a smoke grenade flies in and the room fills with gas and the hunters begin firing wildly. They’re taken out one by one, the assailant hidden by the smoke. Until finally all the hunters are down and the shotgun toting assailant steps out of the smoke and fires into Derek’s gut. Derek explains to Stiles that there are a lot of myths about ways to be turned into a werewolf. He mentions the bite and drinking rainwater from werewolf’s footprint. Derek says he’s not sure it’s a dream because he doesn’t remember waking up. This is why he’s come to Stiles to ask how he knows he’s awake. Stiles has him do the finger counting thing. Stiles has five fingers and one thumb on one hand which suggests Derek is still dreaming. Derek is shot in the chest and drops to his knees on the floor of his loft. Realizing that the situation is real, Derek becomes terrified at the sight of thought-to-be-dead Kate Argent, who transforms into a werejaguar to frighten him more.</p>

Holland Roden portrays Lydia Martin.</div>
</div>
</div>
<p><b>Lydia Martin</b>, portrayed by <a href="/wiki/Holland_Roden" title="Holland Roden">Holland Roden</a>, is Beacon Hills High's most popular female student. Lydia at first appears to be the archetypal promiscuous high school queen bee, but in reality she is surprisingly caring, especially about her friends, and extremely intelligent, excelling in math and science. She is aware of Stiles's feelings for her, but does not reciprocate them. She shows her warm nature in the first episode by befriending Allison on her first day at school. Her love interest is Jackson Whittemore; although in the first season she makes it apparent she is merely dating him due to his high social status, it is later revealed that she cares more about him than she lets on and may even be in love with him. The two share a conflicted, but close relationship. At the start of the series, she gives the impression of barely knowing who Scott and Stiles are, only expressing interest in Scott after he is turned and shows skill at lacrosse. In Season 2, she spends more time with them (in part because they are amongst the few people who don't believe she is crazy). By season 3, she has come to care deeply for them, to the point where she rescued them from a fiery death when Scott had been driven mad through wolfsbane poisoning.</p>
<p>In the season 1 penultimate episode "Formality", Lydia is Bitten by the Alpha werewolf Peter Hale but neither dies nor turns. Instead, she is revealed to be immune. In the beginning of season 2, Lydia recovers, but experiences a hallucination where an arm comes out of the bath water, and, freaking out in a fugue state, she escapes the hospital and runs around in the woods naked for two days. Later she doesn't remember the entire experience at all. Lydia is determined to be immune to the Kanima's venom, and thus Derek assumes Lydia is the Kanima, although it is later revealed to be Jackson. Lydia suffers hallucinations throughout the season, which are eventually revealed to be caused by Peter, who somehow is still alive through her hallucinations and possesses her to use her to return to life. As a result, she learns pieces of the truth of the supernatural events that were happening, though nobody was willing to tell her the whole truth just yet. In the season 2 finale, Lydia selflessly faces the Kanima and successfully coaxes it to transform back into Jackson, by holding up the house key Jackson had given her when they were together. When Jackson asks if she still loves him while he's dying, she responds that she does and embraces him when he is cured of being a Kanima and resurrected as a werewolf.</p>
<p>By Season 3, Lydia has been brought up to speed on the subject of werewolves and the supernatural and offers an update on the now-absent Jackson upon Allison's return. She and Jackson have parted since he moved to London and she is attempting to get over it. She turns to a number of physical lovers as distractions. She enters into a physical relationship with Aidan, initially to distract herself from Jackson, and later to distract Aidan from Scott's activities after she learns Aiden is an Alpha. Lydia displays a strange connection to the events occurring in Beacon Hills in the third season, being mysteriously drawn to the locations of several of the sacrifices and occupying her time with drawing the same tree over and over. Since Scott, Isaac and Allison are preoccupied with the Alpha pack, Lydia joins forces with Stiles to figure out who is really behind the sacrifices. In the episode, "The Girl Who Knew Too Much", when Cora Hale tells Scott, Stiles and she that all they do is find the bodies, not saving anyone Lydia appears at the memorial recital with the decision to stop fighting her strange connections to the murder sites, if it could help save someone and Scott makes the same vow. Later she is held captive by Jennifer Blake, the Darach, who attempts to kill her and she lets out a high pitched scream. It is then revealed by Jennifer that the cause of Lydia's mysterious supernatural abilities stems from the fact that she is actually a <a href="/wiki/Banshee" title="Banshee">banshee</a> or a wailing woman. Lydia and Stiles find out the tree she's been consistently drawing is an inversion of the Nemeton's root system, which allows them realize it's where the kidnapped parents are being held. In the mid-season 3 finale, after Ethan and Aiden switch sides and are killed in their merged form by Jennifer Blake, the Darach, she and Cora get them to Deaton and save their lives. During season 3.5, Lydia continues her liaison with Aiden. In "Galvanize", when mass murderer William Barrow escapes to the high school, Lydia hears a weird buzzing noise similar to the sound of flies. But when Kira Yukimura is kidnapped by Barrow she doesn't receive anything, but when she lets out a banshee scream she hears the buzzing sound much louder and clearer - which is actually the buzzing of electricity as evidenced when Barrow was about to murder Kira by electricity at the power substation. When Stiles goes missing in "Riddled", Lydia hears voices, she follows possible clues concludes Stiles' location is the Eichen House mental institution, but finds out she's wrong which shakes her. Eventually each and every noise Lydia hears disturbingly increase in volume which only she can hear. In "De-Void", Scott is taught by Peter how to utilize an Alpha's power to access someone's mind through his claws, which he does and enters Stiles' mind with Lydia. While inside, they both spot Stiles and the Nogitsune playing the Japanese version of chess <a href="/wiki/Go" title="Go">Go</a>. Lydia reminds Scott that Stiles is a part of his 'pack'. Realizing this, Scott uses his Alpha roar on Stiles, allowing the latter to break free of the Nogitsune. However, the Nogitsune kidnaps Lydia in "Insatiable" and takes her to Camp Oak Creek. She senses the pending death of the Nogitsune which was the reason the Nogitsune took her to know in advance when the Oni would appear to kill him, when they would be in close enough proximity, so he would be able to take control of the demons. It's revealed Lydia had warned the others through a message on her car window not to come for her as she had sensed an impending death. Scott and Stiles find her, but is too late to notify Scott and Stiles the death she's sensing was Allison's as she would be impaled by the Oni. Lydia is overcome with grief as she "feels" Allison's death. In the season finale, Lydia helps come up with a plan to defeat the nogitsune. Shortly following Allison's death, she again "feels" another death - this time it is her former love interest, Aiden. She grieves with Stiles as he dies from an Oni stab wound. Later, she is shown to have promising new relationships with both Kira and Malia as a new life without Allison begins.</p>
<p>Lydia's banshee trait was originally innate in season 1, but Peter's attack on her activated her abilities as revealed by Peter himself. As a banshee Lydia is shown to suffer from fugue states, being drawn to many sites of death such as the graveyard and locations of murders, apparently being able to sense when someone is about to die. Her screams can also be heard by any werewolf within a considerable distance, even if they are outside the normal range for werewolf hearing. Her banshee <i>scream</i> apparently works in the manner of a lever or trigger as she gained a clearer view of the circumstances of Kira's would-be murder by letting out a scream. It is explained by Peter that her <i>scream</i> isn't her only source of power and that it blocks out all surrounding sounds so that she can focus on what only Lydia herself can hear. Lydia is also determined to be immune to supernatural toxins such as the Alpha werewolf's Bite and the Kanima's neurotoxin.</p>
<p><i>Teen Wolf: The Hunt</i>, a <i>Teen Wolf</i>–inspired social network game, states that Lydia was born on March 23. She likes <a href="/wiki/Mu_Alpha_Theta" title="Mu Alpha Theta">Mu Alpha Theta</a>, <a href="/wiki/Figure_skating" title="Figure skating">figure skating</a>, <a href="/wiki/Yoga" title="Yoga">yoga</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Astrophysics" title="Astrophysics">astrophysics</a>, and is a fan of <a href="/wiki/Madonna_(entertainer)" title="Madonna (entertainer)">Madonna</a>, <a href="/wiki/Calvin_Harris" title="Calvin Harris">Calvin Harris</a>, <a href="/wiki/Kids_of_88" title="Kids of 88">Kids of 88</a>, <a href="/wiki/Muse_(band)" title="Muse (band)">Muse</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Kat_Graham" title="Kat Graham">Kat Graham</a>.</p>

Colton Haynes portrays Jackson Whittemore.</div>
</div>
</div>
<p><b>Jackson Whittemore</b>, portrayed by <a href="/wiki/Colton_Haynes" title="Colton Haynes">Colton Haynes</a>, is the former co-captain, of the Beacon Hills <a href="/wiki/Lacrosse" title="Lacrosse">lacrosse</a> team and the former captain of the school's swim team. Jackson's birth parents were Gordon and Margaret Miller. They died in a car crash on June 14, 1995, but Margaret was kept on life support long enough for the doctors to deliver Jackson by <a href="/wiki/Caesarian_section" title="Caesarian section" class="mw-redirect">c-section</a> into the middle of the night as his birthday is <i>June 15th</i>. He was adopted by attorney David Whittemore and his wife. In compensation for their deaths, Jackson is to receive a large insurance settlement on his eighteenth birthday.</p>
<p>Jackson is the big man on campus at Beacon Hills High, and has a competitive, selfish and aggressive nature, which shows through hostility towards people who best him. The show implies that he wants to make others proud of him and this desire to always be the best appears to stem from his insecurity about his adoption and the fact that he does not know his real parents, leading him to be unable to see his adoptive parents as his true mother and father. Despite his abrasive character, he is shown to care for his friends and dislikes hurting them. It turns out he is genuine friends with Danny Mahealani and he actually cares more for Lydia Martin than he lets on, though he'd never admit it. During season 1, Jackson is angered and suspicious by Scott McCall's sudden, seemingly impossible improvement on the lacrosse field and other activities repeatedly besting him. Consequently, he investigates Scott, eventually coming in contact with Derek Hale and being accidentally scratched by Derek in "Magic Bullet" (who was poisoned with wolfs bane at the time and partially passes the poisoning onto Jackson through the claws) and witnessing the Alpha werewolf in "Night School" and eventually discovers Scott is a werewolf. He threatens to expose Scott unless he helps him become a werewolf too. The Argents grew suspicious of Jackson. At the school formal he gets drunk and exposes Scott's werewolf nature to them. In the first season finale, "Code Breaker", he regretted turning Scott over to the Argents, and helps Scott, Allison and Stiles defeat the Alpha werewolf, Peter Hale. Later Jackson appears the Hale house demanding the bite from Derek because he helped him.</p>
<p>In the season two premiere "Omega", it's revealed Derek had bitten Jackson, which he takes with absolute smugness. However, Derek notices his body is rejecting the transformation, causing black blood to bleed out of his orifices. In the fifth episode of season 2 "Venomous" its revealed Jackson instead became a Kanima, a murderous shapeshifting snake/lizard-like creature that is a weapon of vengeance that commits numerous murders throughout season 2. Jackson does not know that he is the Kanima, nor does the Kanima side of him know that it is Jackson. In his Kanima form, Jackson was nigh unstoppable: he had enhanced strength and agility that far exceeded the werewolves, even Derek, the Alpha werewolf, the Kanima could heal from being shot by Chris repeatedly, Derek slashing its throat and Allison hitting it in the head with an arrow and stabbing it in the chest. The Kanima's claws also produced a paralytic poison that could completely immobilize a victim by a Kanima slashing the back of the neck and it could scale walls in the manner of a reptile. The Kanima seeks a master who wishes to exact revenge on others to control it, revealing that as the Kanima, Jackson's every move is controlled by someone else. In the episode "Fury", it's revealed Jackson came across an unstable, traumatized student, Matt Daehler who became his Master. Matt had the Kanima murder former Beacon Hills High students who almost caused him to drown when he was a little boy during a drunken pool party. After Gerard Argent kills Matt, he becomes Jackson's new Master. It is revealed that Jackson became the Kanima because he is an orphan, which is exemplified by his outward behavior and personality, meaning he lacks an identity. He can be saved by a person with whom he shared a true bond; in Jackson's case, this person is Lydia. Through Lydia's selflessness in the second season finale, "Master Plan", the Kanima reverts to Jackson. Aware of what he is, Jackson then allows Derek and Peter Hale to kill him. Dying, he asks Lydia does she still love him, she responds that she does. Jackson then comes back to life and finally becomes a werewolf, however, with blue eyes rather than the common yellow. This is because when a werewolf kills someone who is innocent (regardless of the werewolf's intent in the matter) their eyes turn from yellow to blue; Derek Hale, Peter Hale, the twins Ethan and Aiden and Kincaid share this feature.</p>
<p>"Teen Wolf: The Hunt", a Teen Wolf inspired social network game, states that Jackson was born on June 15. He likes <a href="/wiki/Porsche" title="Porsche">Porsche</a>, <a href="/wiki/Golden_State_Warriors" title="Golden State Warriors">Golden State Warriors</a>, <a href="/wiki/USC_Trojans" title="USC Trojans">USC Trojans</a>, and the <a href="/wiki/San_Jose_Sharks" title="San Jose Sharks">San Jose Sharks</a>, and is a fan of <a href="/wiki/Wiz_Khalifa" title="Wiz Khalifa">Wiz Khalifa</a>, <a href="/wiki/Nicki_Minaj" title="Nicki Minaj">Nicki Minaj</a>, <a href="/wiki/Drake_(entertainer)" title="Drake (entertainer)" class="mw-redirect">Drake</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Gym_Class_Heroes" title="Gym Class Heroes">Gym Class Heroes</a>.</p>
<p>In the Season 3 premiere, Lydia revealed that Jackson was trained by Derek to control his werewolf abilities, and his animal side. Later he and Lydia parted and his father moved him to London.</p>

Arden Cho portrays<br />
Kira Yukimura.</div>
</div>
</div>
<p><b>Kira Yukimura</b>, portrayed by <a href="/wiki/Arden_Cho" title="Arden Cho">Arden Cho</a>, is a Kitsune who forms a relationship with Scott. Kira is the new girl at school, having moved to Beacon Hills from New York three weeks previously with her family. Kira is of Japanese-Korean descent and is a <a href="/wiki/Kitsune" title="Kitsune">kitsune</a>. Kira looks to make friends in school, but has trouble fitting in because of her dad being the new history teacher and is prone to unintentionally embarrassing her. Later, Scott and Kira develop an interest in each other. In "Galvanize", Scott has dinner with Kira and her parents by her father's invitation. Later, mass murderer William Barrow kidnaps her and takes her hostage at his old substation. He takes pictures of her for proof then plans on electrocuting her with a live electrical wire to kill her. Kira manifests a strange ability where she absorbs the power causing the entire town to blackout which Scott witnesses.</p>
<p>In "Illuminated", Kira notices Scott doesn't seem to "run the other way" from her peculiar circumstances. She reveals to him that when she takes pictures of her with the flash on it, the resulting photos show a peculiar glare surrounding her like armor and it's been happening for the past few weeks. Scott invites her to Danny's black light party and their interest in each others strengthens. Later that evening, she witnesses Scott and Derek fight the Oni in their werewolf forms. Consequently, Scott reveals the supernatural status of he and his friends and everything else to her. Kira shows only slight shock, but is ultimately elated as she can actually relate to people concerning her own supernatural status. Kira eventually does research and reveals to Scott that she has come to the theory that she is a kitsune, the Japanese fox trickster spirit and that she is the one the warriors are after. During a lull in the fight against the Oni, Derek Hale confirms her kitsune status, and adds that she probably doesn't even know what type she is. She is more than convinced she is the one the Oni are after, a Nogitsune, but later when the Oni finally get into the house, they test Kira, along with Scott and confirm that she is not the one they seek. When it's realized Stiles is the one possessed by the Nogitsune, she relays information on foxfire to Derek, leading Derek to theorize William Barrow was to supposedly shock her with the intent of activating her foxfire ability to charge the Nogitsune's strength and hold over Stiles during the struggle at the power substation. Kira subdues a sabotaged electrical cable by absorbing the current into her hands; her mother Noshiko hurriedly lets her know she saw what Kira did, but doesn't elaborate further. In "Letharia Vulpina", Kira remains suspicious of her parents, and discovers her mother Noshiko is responsible for bringing the Oni to Beacon Hills. Afterwards, Kira helps out, wanting to help save Stiles and cure him, warning Scott about the Oni and accompanying the gang in retrieving the Shugendō scroll.</p>
<p>In "The Fox and the Wolf", Kira confronts her parents, along with Scott, over the recent events and searching for answers about the photo during 1943 that shows someone who looks like Kira and the sheathed sword Stiles and Malia found at Eichen House. Kira is distrustful towards her mom and is further baffled when Noshiko reveals the girl in the photo is her and she is actually 900 years old. Noshiko tells her story of her time as an intern at Camp Oak Creek and her role in unleashing the Nogitsune. Noshiko asks Kira to trust her this once, tells her she is a Thunder kitsune and shows her how to use her talent to repair the shattered sword. She tells Kira Noshiko's legacy is now Kira's when she passes her the sword to stop the Nogitsune. In "Insatiable", Kira masters her fighting abilities, and is taught the ancient game <a href="/wiki/Goe" title="Goe" class="mw-redirect">Goe</a> by her mother. Later, Kira realises in order to save Stiles she must go up against her mother and the Oni. However, both women are too late in stopping the Nogitsune, as he takes control of the Oni and kills Allison.</p>
<p>In "The Divine Move", Kira takes on the Nogitsune with the surviving pack. She battles the Oni and then fatally stabs the Nogitsune after Scott bites him and transforms him into a werewolf. Later, Kira realises she needs to give Scott time to grieve Allison and distances herself.</p>
<p>Kitsune, Kira has displayed an affinity for electricity, absorbing gigawatts of electrical power and being able to bled out electrical energy into a light bulb through her fingertips: her mother has identified her as a Thunder kitsune. Kira gives off an aura that is shaped around her like a flaring armor in the shape of an <a href="/wiki/Anthropomorphism" title="Anthropomorphism">anthropomorphic</a> fox that Kira hasn't learned how to conceal yet. This aura is visible to a werewolf by the use of their enhanced vision or to anyone who views a photograph of her taken with a <a href="/wiki/Flash_(photography)" title="Flash (photography)">flash</a>. Kira has also displayed supernatural strength, reflexes and speed similar to a werewolf; in addition, She possesses a natural instinct for swordplay; her mother says it gives her balance, Kira also has a increased healing ability explained to her by her mother when she cuts her own hand and wipes the blood away to reveal the wound has healed instantaneously, telling Kira she has the same abilities also including that she will never get sick or suffer any illness. When utilizing her abilities, Kira's eyes glow a bright orange.</p>
<p>When it is revealed that there are 13 types of Kitsune by Katashi in the episode entitles "Silverfinger", Short there after we discover from Kira`s mother that Kira is in fact a Thunder Kitsune which explains her affinity for absorbing and containing electricity within herself, which gives her supernatural abilities, One including repairing the damaged Kitsune katana her mother used to kill the "Nogitsune" in the 1943 internment camp which resulted with it shattering In the episode entitled "The Fox And The Wolf", Kira uses her abilities as a thunder kitsune and restores the sword using something similar to the foxfire she created in "Galvanize", Once the sword is fully repaired she takes it and not long after plunges it into the "Nogitsune" providing a killing stroke , A loud thunder sound can be heard once the sword is impaled into the "Nogitsune", Unlike the first time the sword was used to kill the "Nogitsune" in 1943 by her mother this time it did not shatter after it was used to kill the host containing Dark Kitsune.</p>

Shelley Henning portrays Malia Tate.</div>
</div>
</div>
<p><b>Malia Tate</b>, portrayed by <a href="/wiki/Shelley_Hennig" title="Shelley Hennig">Shelley Hennig</a>, is a werecoyote and the legal daughter of Mr. Tate. Although she was thought to be dead for eight years from a car accident that claimed the lives of her mother and younger sister, and the the corpses were covered in bite marks from coyotes when she was nine, Malia was actually living fully transformed as a werecoyote for the intervening eight years. Malia has blue eyes in her shifted form. On the night of the car crash Malia had shapeshifted on a full moon. Her transformation had caused the car accident and killed her mom and sister in the process. During the years she was missing, Malia lived in a den near the crash site and kept many of her human clothes there. She had a sentimental attachment to her sister's doll, holing it at the crash site for her sister, akin to the manner of leaving flowers at a grave and when Stiles removed it from the crash site, she tracked it first to the high school then to her father's house to retrieve it. In the episode "More Bad Than Good", Malia is almost shot by her father as he thought the coyote killed his family, but she is saved by Allison who fires a tranquilizer dart at Mr. Tate. Scott uses his new Alpha werewolf roar to force Malia to become human again. Sheriff Stilinski and Stiles bring her home and she is reunited with her father at the end of the episode.</p>
<p>In "Letharia Vulpina", Lydia learns from listening to Talia Hale's claws using her banshee abilities that Malia is actually Peter Hale's daughter, a memory that Talia had wiped from her brother's mind to protect the child.</p>
<p>In "Echo House", Malia is interned at Eichen House mental hospital. There, she sees Stiles who has voluntarily committed himself to prevent the Nogitsune from hurting anyone. When he walks up to Malia, she punches him. Malia later tells Stiles she is unhappy living as a human, because she now lives back with her father and can't explain to him that she feels guilt that she killed her mom and sister on a full moon. She's resentful towards Stiles and Scott because Scott's Alpha roar has caused her to no longer be able to transform. Stiles, who is looking for a way to get into the basement, makes a deal with her: if she helps him get into the basement, he will tell her that Scott can teach her how to transform back into a werecoyote. In the basement, Malia implores Stiles to reveal what's going on with him, telling him she won't judge him as she "murdered her family". Stiles lets her in on the know and the pair try to look for some clues to the Nogitsune and the significance of the kanji "self" on the wall. Stiles and Malia bond over their shared horrors. Eventually Malia suddenly kisses him, to his mutual consent. They end up having sex. Afterwards, Malia realizes that the wall of the basement marked with the kanji is hollow. The pair break through the wall and discover what they assume to be the host body of the Nogitsune. Malia finds a sheathed katana and a photograph on the corpse, but before Stiles can identify anyone in the photo, they are attacked by Oliver, Stiles' roommate, who is the "<a href="/wiki/Renfield" title="Renfield">Renfield</a>" to the Nogitsune's "<a href="/wiki/Dracula" title="Dracula">Dracula</a>". Stiles lets the Nogitsune back in, in exchange for the spirit calling off Oliver and sparing Malia. Malia later prepares to leave Eichen House, intending to rescue Stiles. Impressed with her change of character, Ms. Morrell tells Malia where to find Scott; as she departs, Malia's eyes flash blue. She eventually brings the sheathed sword and the photo to Scott and his friends.</p>
<p>In "The Divine Move", Malia enrolls into Beacon Hills High School and joins Scott's pack. She is last seen with Stiles and Scott, with the later starting to teach her how to control her supernatural abilities.</p>

</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Laura was Derek's older sister and also a born werewolf. She survived the Hale Fire because she was in school at the time with her brother Derek. Laura was presumably groomed by her mother Talia<sup id="cite_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7"><span>[</span>7<span>]</span></a></sup> to become the next Alpha werewolf of the family. It has been suggested Laura could have gained the Alpha status by a natural line of succession after her family was killed in the fire and her uncle Peter was induced into a coma. Laura had the capability to transform into a fully formed canine wolf while in her werewolf state. It is assumed she was taught this skill from Talia before her death. After the fire, Derek and Laura left Beacon Hills for New York. Laura was lured back to Beacon Hills six years later by a photo depicting a dead deer with the spiral painted on it, a symbol that represents revenge amongst werewolf packs. Laura had begun to investigate who was responsible for the Hale fire. She was able to uncover some information, coming face to face with Adrian Harris. Harris drew her the necklace of the woman (Kate Argent) whom he'd drunkenly babbled to about how to start an arson fire and get away with it. She came across her uncle Peter who was left comatose because of the fire and he killed her to steal her Alpha status. The discovery of the lower half of her body in the Beacon Hills Preserve sparked the plot for the series pilot. Derek Hale found the top half of her body and buried it outside the Hale house with a wolfsbane studded rope arranged around the grave in the shape of the spiral. In "The Tell", Kate Argent admitted to Derek she came across Laura's body and had it cut in half to use as bait to capture Derek but verified to Derek that they didn't kill her.</dd>

<dd>Peter is Derek's uncle, a hereditary werewolf and was the main antagonist of season 1. In the Hale Fire, he was badly burned and assumed to be paralyzed for six years. In the episode "Wolf's Bane", he was revealed to be the Alpha werewolf who had Bitten Scott McCall and committed the murders throughout season 1 who were arsonists and conspirators directly involved in the Hale Fire. In the Season 1 finale, he kills Kate Argent, the final culprit directly involved in the fire, and was burned alive by Scott, Allison, Stiles, and Jackson, before getting his throat slashed by Derek.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>In Season 2, Peter remains alive through Lydia's hallucinations and he controls her in an as-of-yet unexplained manner to return to life in "Party Guessed" by using Derek's power as an Alpha to resurrect himself. It is revealed by show producer Jeff Davis and, later by Alan Deaton, that Peter lost his Alpha status and reverted to a Beta werewolf class upon resurrection<sup id="cite_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8"><span>[</span>8<span>]</span></a></sup> and his abilities are shown to be impaired. He has an uneasy truce and partnership with Derek and the rest of the group after helping them against the Kanima. It's revealed in flashbacks when he was younger Peter was a manipulator, a lurker as shown when he'd spied on his older sister Talia's meeting with the delegations from other packs and a liar, but he cared about his family. He was traumatized into a coma by the Hale fire, caused by Kate Argent and her co-conspirators, the death of his family and the six years he spent comatose and healing "cell by cell". By the time he came out of his coma, Peter became a completely different person, Peter is now sociopathic, vengeful, intelligent, calculating, sarcastic and witty. Peter showed some remorse for murdering his niece Laura when confronted about it. In Season 3, Peter is shown to somewhat care about his remaining family members, Derek and his other niece Cora, while also retaining some of his previous selfishness, sneakiness and malice. It's revealed his werewolf eyes as a Beta werewolf are blue, meaning he has taken innocent lives. Show creator <a href="/wiki/Jeff_Davis_(writer)" title="Jeff Davis (writer)">Jeff Davis</a> has confirmed this is not because of killing his niece Laura or his murder spree throughout season 1 and actor Ian Bohen has revealed Peter has killed "numerous" innocents. He tells the story of what happened to Derek when he was 15 to Cora and Stiles, explaining that Derek was forced to kill his first love, Paige, and in turn made his werewolf eyes blue. However, during the course of his perspective, it is revealed that Peter lied about some of the story, which Stiles catches onto. Peter had relayed to them that Derek brought up the idea to turning Paige, but that Peter had tried to convince Derek not to go through with it. In reality, he had snidely talked Derek into the idea and had asked Alpha werewolf Ennis to Bite her. When Cora is dying of <a href="/wiki/Mistletoe" title="Mistletoe">mistletoe poisoning</a> in "Alpha Pact", Peter tells Derek of a technique used by Alphas to cure sickness with pain transference as a way to save her, but he'll give up the "spark" that makes him an Alpha. He feigns concern over Derek faring as a Beta when Kali comes for him, but when Derek decides to go through with it, Peter sneakily grins in triumph. In the mid-season finale, after Scott becomes a True Alpha, Peter kills Jennifer after she attempts to re-energize herself using the Nemeton again, who reveals that he plans to kill Scott to become an Alpha werewolf again. Peter proudly and malevolently boasts that he's "always been 'the Alpha'".</dd>

<dd>In Season 3.5, Peter goes along with Derek on the latter's mission to recover his sister Talia's unique claws from a clan of Hispanic hunters in South America. After retrieving the claws Derek has Peter use Talia's claws to initiate a ritual so that Derek could communicate with Talia and ask her a question, in exchange he tells his nephew he wants to keep the claws. In "Letharia Vulpina", Peter leaves Lydia a subtle message to help her control her banshee powers which he promises he will do on the condition that she do something for him: he wants her to listen to his sister Talia's claws and discover a memory that she had taken from him before her death. He managed to get her to listen and she discovers that Talia had wiped the memory that Peter had fathered a child, but refrains from telling him more. When she refuses to tell him who his child is, Peter attacks her but is electrocuted by Allison before he can do anything. Lydia later informs Allison that Malia Tate, the werecoyote, is Peter's daughter. In "De-Void", after the gang paralyze the Void Stiles' body, Lydia calls Peter for help and he complies on the condition Lydia give him his child's name. Peter determines that Stiles' situation is one of the mind. He teaches Scott to utilize an Alpha's power to enter someone else's mind so that he and Lydia can enter Stiles' mind to find Stiles and guide him back. Lydia then gives Peter Malia's name.</dd>

<li><b>Isaac Lahey</b> (portrayed by <a href="/wiki/Daniel_Sharman" title="Daniel Sharman">Daniel Sharman</a>) (Seasons 2 - 3), is a Beta werewolf, Scott's close friend and former roommate. He was Bitten by Derek Hale as an Alpha werewolf. In the past Isaac was abused and tormented by his father, who tortured him by often locking him in their basement freezer. His mother is also deceased and his older brother Camden was killed in combat overseas. Isaac is turned into a werewolf by Derek and becomes the first member of Derek's pack. He asked to become a werewolf to feel powerful and confident after all the abuse from his father, who is murdered by the Kanima at the beginning of Season 2.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Isaac was the first of Derek's Beta werewolves to gain control of his animal side during the full moon, and in spite of his dark family-life, Isaac has good intentions and a warm heart. At first, Isaac did not like Scott and did not trust him, due to the fact that he was interfering in Derek's business of turning people into werewolves, and believed Scott was a loser because he wondered how Scott survived so long without a pack. Nevertheless, he eventually trusted Scott when he realized Scott has good intentions, and became friends with him. Among the dangerous events throughout Season 2, Isaac sides with Scott, revealing that he trusts him and holds onto Scott's friendship because he doesn't have anyone there for him. He helps Scott against Gerard when Gerard takes control of the Kanima, but he is stabbed by Allison. Isaac stays as a part of Derek's pack instead of following Boyd and Erica, who want to leave Derek for their own safety. He learns from Peter that an Alpha pack has arrived into town.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>At the beginning of Season 3, Isaac is chased by the twins and doesn't remember anything prior to the chase. A mysterious girl saves him, but she and Isaac are injured and sent to the hospital. Melissa McCall tries to call Derek for help as Isaac's wounds are already healing and he's supposed to go into surgery. When Derek cannot be reached, Isaac asks Melissa to call Scott. Before Scott can get to the hospital, Isaac is drugged and kidnapped by the Alphas. He is then rescued by Derek and Scott. Dr. Deaton helps Isaac remember the night he found Boyd and Erica by slowing down his heart in an ice bath and discovers that Erica is already dead, while Boyd is still alive and is being held captive by the Alpha pack with another werewolf named Cora. He later participates in helping Scott and Derek capture Boyd and Cora, who are rabid from the full moon with assistance from Chris Argent. He was shown to despise the Alpha twins, Aiden and Ethan, blaming them for the death of the girl who saved him and the numerous sacrifices, and stands off against them. Allison apologizes to Isaac for attacking him last season and assists him in his vendetta against the twins. He teams up with her against the threats throughout the season becoming closer. After being thrown out of Derek's loft by Derek to protect him from the Alphas, he moves in with Scott and Melissa. In "Alpha Pact", Isaac later becomes fed up over the deaths of Boyd and Erica, and confronts Derek about how people always die around him and how he only cares about power. He also starts to have more respect for Scott than Derek, seeing that Scott is willing to defend everyone and not kill. Isaac and Allison develop feelings for each other, so much Isaac is chosen to be her tether when she undertakes a dangerous druid ritual to find her father. During the mid-season finale, he helps Allison, Stiles, and Scott find their parents and leaves Derek's pack after Scott becomes a True Alpha werewolf.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>In the episode "Anchors" of season three, Isaac starts acting on his feelings towards Allison, even attempting to kiss her, following her for her protection and arriving at her apartment, to her consent. He is open about this with Scott who is evidently uncomfortable at their budding relationship. He comforts Allison when she goes through the after-effects of her druid sacrifice and shows his confidence in her allowing her to regain her sharp-shooting skills. Isaac is still antagonistic towards Ethan and Aiden saying they can't join Scott's pack because of their part in Boyd's death. After helping Allison with research on William Barrow, (and teasing each other sexually) Isaac is confronted and "tagged" by the Oni. He later helps Allison and Chris retrieve information about the Oni, Kitsune and the Nogitsune from the Yakuza recluse, Katashi "Silver finger". He and Allison affirm their feelings for each other when Allison kisses him. Isaac is induced into a coma in "Letharia Vulpina", saving Allison from stepping into electrified water as one of the traps set by the Nogitsune possessing Stiles. In "De-Void", Isaac comes out of his coma and heals from his injuries, to Allison's happiness and they have sex. Later it's realized Isaac is possessed by one of the Nogitsune's flies and his demeanor darkens, particularly his vendetta towards Ethan and Aiden. He has Allison shackled to her bed and steals weapons from her. After knocking the twins out, he plans to set them on fire as revenge for them helping to kill Erica and Boyd. He is forced to fight them both when Kira and Allison come to save them. Fortunately, they are all cured after Scott frees Stiles from the Nogitsune. In "Insatiable", Isaac assists Stiles and Scott with finding Lydia. After arriving at Oak Creek, Isaac fights alongside Allison and Kira against the now Nogitsune-controlled Oni. He is eventually outmatched and sliced multiple times by two of the Oni. He is saved by Allison, who is fatally stabbed by the Oni soon after. Visibly shocked and stricken, Isaac watches on as Allison dies in Scott's arms. In "The Divine Move", Isaac is devastated by Allison's death. Later, Isaac remembers that Allison wanted Scott to tell Chris something. When Chris tells him about her forging her silver arrowhead, Isaac figures out that she had discovered that silver was the Oni's weakness and that her arrows could destroy them. Chris and Isaac head to the school with the silver arrows and destroy the remaining Oni. After Scott and Kira exorcise the Nogitsune, Isaac imprisons the dark spirit in Derek's triskele cylinder which is made out of the wood of the Nemeton. Later, Isaac and Chris are seen leaving the Argents' flat with imprisoned Nogitsune, apparently leaving to hide it somewhere where no one would ever find it. Isaac decides to leaves Beacon Hills.</dd>

In the episode "Motel California", when Boyd is hallucinating, poisoned by <a href="/wiki/Wolfsbane" title="Wolfsbane">wolfsbane</a>, it's revealed he had a younger sister named Alicia. She and Boyd had gone ice-skating when Boyd was younger, when Alicia suddenly disappeared and was never seen again. Boyd felt terrible guilt over not watching his sister.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>In season 2, he is first seen in episode "Ice Pick". Boyd becomes the third member of Derek's pack, completing the basic requirement for an actual werewolf pack. He joined so he wouldn't have to be the high school loner anymore. For most of the season, he was Derek's right-hand man and physically the strongest Beta werewolf of the pack. Derek treated Boyd distinctly differently from the way he treated Isaac and Erica. Isaac and Erica were sent in like attack dogs, while Derek held Boyd in reserve, as he was more mature and stronger than them. In "Party Guessed", he experiences his first full moon as a werewolf; he goes feral and almost gets loose but is subdued by a more successful Isaac. Boyd was close to Erica. They both became frightened of the Argents' vendetta, especially when the whole pack had to go on the run and left Derek with her to find another pack at the end of Season 2, becoming Omegas. The pair are lead into a trap by the Argents using recorded wolf howls. Boyd saves Erica from being shot with an arrow by a vengeful Allison, but she relentlessly fires arrows into him, but Chris Argent shoots her bow away saving Boyd's life. After a short altercation with and capture by the Argents, Chris rebels against his family and sets them free. He and Erica attempt to flee Beacon Hills, but are trapped by the Alpha pack, leaving their fate uncertain.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>In Season 3, it is revealed that Boyd and possibly Erica were alive and had been held captive by the Alpha pack for four months in the abandoned Beacon Hills First National Bank. During this four-month period, he and Erica had a heart-to-heart about them possibly becoming stronger during the lunar eclipse. Erica tried to fight back against the Alphas, but was killed. Boyd and Cora, Derek's younger sister who was also captured, were refrained from fully transforming during the full moons, by the <a href="/wiki/Moonstone_(gemstone)" title="Moonstone (gemstone)">hecatolite</a> lined in the bank vault keeping the full moon from reaching them. This caused their rage and bloodlust to build up inside for months. He became friends with Cora over this experience. Upon being found by Derek and Scott, both of them lost all control and escaped into the woods to kill whomever they came across. They were later subdued by Derek, with assistance from Scott, Isaac and Chris Argent. Boyd re-joined Derek's pack and returned to school still upset over the death of Erica. He participated in the pack's battle against the Alpha pack, taking on Ennis with Cora, but is easily defeated by them. Knowing that Kali would eventually come to kill Derek to "avenge" Ennis' death, Boyd came up with a plan to weaken Kali using electrified water. The plan failed when the Alphas cut the power supply to the building. During Derek's fight with Kali, Boyd is held captive by Kali and she has the twins Ethan and Aiden hold Derek's claws up. Kali then kills Boyd by impaling him upon Derek's claws, which caused the latter to absorb Boyd's powers and see his memory of Erica's death, which shatters him emotionally. Dying, Boyd comforts Derek by telling him to not blame himself for everything that has happened and that the sensation of the full moon was worth everything.</dd>

<dd>At the hospital after a seizure in "Ice Pick", Derek seduces her with the Bite, promising her that not only her epilepsy would go away, along with the side-effects, but she would become even better. Erica accepted the Bite, becoming a werewolf and the second member of Derek's pack. She changed remarkably, her originally timid, self-conscious personality becoming more confident, snarky, flirtatious and stylish. She revealed that she used to have a huge crush on Stiles, but he never noticed her since he was "too busy" with his crush to Lydia. Erica was shown to be close to both Isaac and Boyd throughout the season, and repeatedly antagonized Allison. Erica had hit on Scott twice, hinting that she was attracted to him. She along with the rest of the pack, attempted to stop the Kanima and goes rabid on her first full moon and has to be restrained by Derek. At the end of Season 2, terrified of the Argents' werewolf genocide she and Boyd decide to leave Derek to find a new pack, becoming Omega werewolves in the process, but are lead into a trap by the werewolf hunters. Erica is almost killed by a corrupted Allison, angry over her mother's death, but Boyd saves her life catching the arrow but is plummeted by multiple arrows from Allison. Erica hysterically begs Allison to stop when she readies a seventh shot, but Boyd is saved by Chris Argent. In the season 2 finale, they were held hostage by Gerard, but were freed by Chris.

In the past, Deucalion was the leader of his original pack and his emissary was Marin Morrell. He and a few members of his pack had come to Beacon Hills for an important meeting to discuss the threat of the Argent werewolf-hunter family. Fellow Alpha Ennis wanted help to combat the Argents because they had killed one of his Beta werewolves. Deucalion reasoned saying they killed his Beta because he killed two of theirs. Ennis declared revenge, anyway. Deucalion wanted to avoid bloodshed to make peace with the Argents. He met with Alpha werewolf Talia Hale and her emissary, Dr. Alan Deaton to seek their advice before meeting with Gerard Argent. He and three of his Beta werewolves were instead tricked and ambushed by Gerard, who not only killed Deucalion's Betas, but his own men who wanted peace with the werewolves. He later blinded Deucalion in an unsuccessful attempt to kill him.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>With the help of Deaton, Deucalion's eyes healed physically, but his sight didn't return. This discovery coupled with Gerard's betrayal enraged Deucalion. Marco, another of his Betas, took this opportunity to try and kill Deucalion to become the Alpha werewolf of their pack. Deucalion, however, realized he could see using his werewolf eyes and killed Marco in retaliation. In doing so he realized Alphas became stronger when they kill their own Betas. The entire experience corrupted Deucalion. Eventually he killed the rest of his pack to add all of their powers to his own and lead fellow Alphas Kali and Ennis to do the same. Sometime after, he came across the twins (Aiden and Ethan) who were "the bitches" in a brutal pack. Deucalion taught them how to control their merged form to fight back against their abusers and they joined him after killing their original Alpha. He pulled all five of them together to form an Alpha pack. He even had all the members kill their emissaries, except for Marin, his own. Deucalion eventually came to be known as "the Demon Wolf".</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Deucalion's Alpha pack arrived in Beacon Hills in the season 2 finale, capturing Boyd and Erica in the process. In "Unleashed", Deucalion goes to Derek's loft along with Kali and Ennis to offer Derek a proposition for Derek to kill his own pack to join his own with the intention of recruiting him. Chris Argent began hunting him when its revealed he had bitten a member of the Argent family, Alexander Argent, in 1977 which led to his suicide. It is later realized that Deucalion knows that Scott has the potential to become a "True Alpha", someone who can rise to Alpha status purely by strength and merit of character (a rarity among werewolves) and is after him, not Derek. Deucalion's intentions throughout season 3 were to push Scott into a position to either join his pack or have Scott kill somebody destroying his True Alpha potential eliminating Scott as a potential threat to him. When the new killer committing human sacrifices is revealed to be a Darach, Deucalion became interested and had his pack hunt it down. He is concerned with the Darach because it used to be a druid, or an emissary to werewolf packs, who can call upon powers from sacrifices. After finding out that the Darach is Jennifer, Kali's old emissary, Deucalion tried to have her killed. Scott later tearfully joins Deucalion's pack in "The Overlooked" in return for Deucalion's offer to help look for his kidnapped mother. In "Alpha Pact", he tries to have his emissary, Marin, killed when he suspects her to have had a role with the human sacrifices and she confirms to have had been working against him to "maintain balance", but Scott ultimately saves her. In the mid-season 3 finale, Deucalion and Scott face off against Jennifer and Derek (who Jennifer forced into helping him). Deucalion shifts into his 'Demon Wolf' persona and overpowers both of them easily. He then tries to force Scott into killing Jennifer to become an Alpha, but Scott blinds him using flash bolts as he could see as a wolf. During the lunar eclipse, Deucalion temporarily loses his powers and Jennifer is to be able to defeat him. After being beaten to a pulp, Jennifer is tricked by Derek into healing his normal eyesight to allow him to see her true form and the result of his crimes on her but Jennifer is weakened because of this. After the lunar eclipse passes and Scott awakens his True Alpha powers by breaking through Jennifer's mountain ash barrier, Deucalion saves Scott from becoming a killer to stop Jennifer from sacrificing the kidnapped parents by doing it himself, slashing her throat. Derek and Scott decide to let him go giving him the chance to redeem himself on the condition he tries to maintain peace between werewolves and humans. His current whereabouts remain unknown.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>In the episode, "More Bad than Good", it is revealed he hired the mercenary Braeden to rescue Derek and Peter Hale from a clan of Hispanic hunters.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Deucalion is sociopathic, obsessive, vain, charismatic, power-hungry, willing to kill anyone who gets in his way, and not above killing members of his Alpha pack (which he does to Ennis), if they are useless to him. It remains to be seen if he will change, as Scott and Derek spared him, giving him the chance to redeem himself. Deucalion possesses abilities far greater than that of an average Alpha werewolf, that he is able to command a pack of exceptionally strong Alphas with both fear and respect. Unlike most werewolves, Deucalion's transformed state is more demonic than wolf-like. In this form, his skin turns dark blue/grey and his facial structure changes making him look more demonic and unlike other werewolves, Deucalion has no visible hair growth in this form. His strength and speed are increased to the point where he easily bested Jennifer, powered by the Nemeton, and Derek, without suffering damage and appeared as a blur when he moved. Deucalion has an Alpha werewolf's special ability to hide his scent as Scott couldn't identify him as a werewolf when he first encountered Scott. He also has the ability to force other werewolves to shift with a powerful roar.</dd>

<dd>Ethan and Aiden (last name not revealed) were twin werewolves, former members of Deucalion's Alpha pack and Omega werewolves. They were originally members of a pack of infamously brutal werewolves which Ethan described as being killers and their Alpha having been the worst. Their emissary was also dead. The twins were constantly mistreated, abused by all the others; Ethan admitted to them being something like "the bitches" of the pack. After meeting Deucalion, he taught them how to harness a form where they could merge as one. Once they mastered the skill they proceeded to eliminate each member of the pack, eventually both becoming Alpha werewolves themselves after killing their Alpha together. Out of fealty and supposedly fear, they joined Deucalion's Alpha pack.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Enrolling at Beacon Hills High in season 3A, they repeatedly antagonize Isaac and Scott. Ethan is gay and begins pursuing Danny Mahealani, while Aiden begins a liaison with Lydia. Ethan and Aiden initially seduced Danny and Lydia respectively to try and get leverage and information on Scott and his allies, but Ethan's feelings for Danny eventually turn genuine. Aiden insists that his feelings for Lydia are fabricated, though they in fact run deeper than he would like to admit. Ethan's relationship with Danny softens the Alpha to the point where he meets Scott halfway in the episode "Currents" explaining he won't harm Danny, as he realizes that Danny isn't part of Scott's group but now knows that Lydia is. When the Alphas have Derek kill Boyd by hand as per Kali's order, Ethan shows guilt for his actions, which Scott catches onto. Having Lydia distract Aiden, Scott and Stiles confront Ethan for conformation concerning whether or not the Darach could have been an emissary to any one of them in "The Girl Who Knew Too Much". Ethan relays their story to them, explaining how they owe Deucalion and lets them know that Morrell, Deucalion's emissary, was the only emissary spared. Ethan betrays the Alpha Pack in the mid-Season 3 finale, "Lunar Ellipse", to help Derek and Cora escape from Kali, enlisting Lydia's help and Aiden is quick to join his brother turning on Kali when she threatens Lydia. Unexpectedly, this confrontation is interrupted by the arrival of Jennifer Blake, whom is the Darach. The twins fight Jennifer in separate one-on-one duels, but ultimately decide to merge into their super-werewolf form when they are overpowered and Kali is killed. Still they prove unsuccessful, when Jennifer snaps their merged form's neck and appear dead. Minutes later, they demerge as individuals, barely alive. Fortunately, Lydia and Cora get them to Deaton, who helps save their lives.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Following the dissolution of Deucalion's Alpha pack and the Darach's defeat in season 3.5, they've lost their Alpha status and their ability to merge into their super-werewolf form in their feat to survive so they disappear for a couple of weeks, with Ethan apparently breaking up with Danny. Later, in the episode "More Bad Than Good", they assist Scott in controlling his new Alpha werewolf powers. In "Galvanize", they reveal they need to join a new pack as they are now Omegas and people will come for them because of their time as part of Deucalion's fearsome Alpha pack. They come to ask Scott to join his pack. Isaac and Stiles are vehemently against this and Scott says no as they don't trust them, particularly because of their part in Boyd's murder. Later, they decide to re-enroll in high school with the intention of earning Scott's trust to have him change his mind. Aiden continues his physical relationship with Lydia but she eventually states that she uses her supernatural abilities to help save lives, while all she sees is how he helped kill Boyd. Ethan, meanwhile catches Danny making out with his ex-boyfriend and appears hurt. To make a fresh start, they help Danny throw his black light party during the blackout using a power generator and Derek's loft –&#160;while Ethan's efforts are appreciated by Danny, Lydia is unimpressed by Aiden's antics. The twins help out with the threats such as finding the serial killer William Barrow, combating the Oni, where they are both "tagged" by the said demons and helping out with the chaos caused by Stiles under the Nogitsune's possession. In "De-Void", the twins are both infected by the flies expelled by the Nogitsune. They become antagonistic with each other, eventually going feral attacking each other along with Isaac, who's also infected and raging on the fact they helped kill Boyd and Erica. All three werewolves are cured when Scott frees Stiles from the Nogitsune. In "Insatiable", they assist with finding Lydia by trying to catch her scent in the woods. After hearing a gun being chambered, they are both shot multiple times with wolfsbane laced bullets by unknown assailants. Struggling to escape, they are eventually saved by Derek who hides them in the werecoyote den. The twins believe that the shooters are people they antagonized in the past when they were apart of the Alpha pack. They are later taken to Derek's loft by the latter and Chris Argent. In the Season 3.5 finale, "The Divine Move" they later assist Derek with fighting the Nogitsune and two of the Oni. After a prolonged fight, they are saved by Chris Argent, who begins to kill the Oni with Allison's silver-tipped arrows. Aiden destroys an Oni with a silver arrowhead, only to be fatally stabbed himself. Bleeding heavily and dying, Aiden is held in Derek's arms while Ethan cries over him. Aiden tearfully states that Lydia will have a hard time thinking he became a good guy, but Derek reassures he will tell her himself. After passing away, Aiden's death is "felt" by Lydia, which deeply saddens her. With the loss of his brother, Ethan decides to leave Beacon Hills. Danny breaks up with him and reveals that he knows Ethan is a werewolf, which shocks the latter. He then gives Ethan a kiss goodbye.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Ethan and Aiden are the first twin werewolves to appear in the series. The twins had a talent to sense when the other is in pain and have the power to physically merge their bodies into a single more powerful werewolf form. However, when Jennifer Blake killed their "super-werewolf" form, their feat to survive as individual werewolves cost them their Alpha status and their ability to merge, and their werewolf eye colour has changed to blue, as a sign they've killed innocents, as Ethan had confirmed the two of them to have killed their original Alpha werewolf in their merged form. Personality-wise, Ethan is calm, reserved, calculating, passive and shows remorse for his actions, as while Aiden was impulsive, aggressive, cocky, spontaneous and prone to violence. Both twins have a sense of honor as they followed Deucalion after he helped them fight back against their abusers in their original pack, and they both show guilt for their actions against Scott's circle of allies.</dd>

<ul>
<li><b>Kali</b> (<a href="/wiki/Felisha_Terrell" title="Felisha Terrell">Felisha Terrell</a>) (Season 3)</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Kali was an Alpha werewolf and a member of Deucalion's Alpha Pack and a secondary antagonist of season 3. She was one of the most dangerous Alpha werewolves and used the claws on her feet to fight in a martial arts form of combat. Kali was Deucalion's right hand in his Alpha pack, though Deucalion mentioned later, she joined his pack so she could be with Ennis, implying she and Ennis were involved with each other. Kali was ruthless, arrogant, sadistic, cowardly and had no remorse for her actions; like Deucalion and Ennis, Kali murdered her entire pack to add all their power to hers, which she states felt "liberating" and she was responsible for the death of Erica. After their pack's battle with Derek's pack, Kali is shown to be worried over Ennis' condition from his fight with Derek. With Aiden and Morrell's help, they get Ennis to Deaton's clinic for treatment. She is devastated when Deucalion reports that Ennis has died from his wounds (in truth Deaton had actually saved Ennis, but Deucalion killed him to entice Kali into coming for Derek to further his plans for Derek and Scott). Kali eventually fought Derek one-on-one at his loft, having Ethan and Aiden hold Derek's girlfriend Jennifer Blake hostage and disabling the trap Boyd had set with the electrified water. During the fight, Kali gets a hold of Boyd and has Derek inadvertently kill him so to have him absorb Boyd's powers with an ultimatum: Derek has to join their pack by the full moon or she would kill him and all of his pack in repentance for Ennis' death.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>In the episode "The Overlooked", when the Alpha pack began hunting the Darach, which is revealed to be Jennifer, it's revealed she is actually Julia Baccari, Kali's former emissary. When Deucalion confronted her, Kali admitted she'd attempted to kill Julia, as part of killing her entire pack in order to join Deucalion's Alpha pack, but she'd loved Julia and was unable to do it in the end and left her to die. Kali felt genuine remorse for this. The Alphas attempted to kill Jennifer, but were foiled by Scott and his allies. In the mid-season finale, she and Aiden show up at Derek's loft to kill Derek, only to have their plans foiled by Ethan - who betrayed them. Kali demands to know where Derek is. Aiden is quick to join his brother after she threatens Lydia. Kali confronts Aiden over his loyalties when he becomes violent in his supposed defection. However, this turn of events is interrupted by Jennifer, who breaks into the loft through the glass roof. Kali takes her on, but is overpowered. Jennifer confronts Kali about her new glamored form, asking her what it takes to be able to look normal to spite Kali as the malicious Alpha had ruined her real face when she'd attempted to kill her. Kali fires back saying she doesn't care, but Jennifer darkly responds saying "it takes power. Power like this", and uses telekinesis to levitate shards of the broken glass off the floor. Kali shows fear at this display, but ultimately refused to back down in arrogance and screams she "should've ripped (Julia's) head off", and Jennifer fires the glass shards into Kali's body, violently killing her.</dd>

</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Ennis was an Alpha werewolf, part of Deucalion's Alpha Pack and an antagonist of season 3. In the past, one of Ennis's Betas accidentally killed two werewolf hunters and was killed in retaliation. This enraged and saddened Ennis because he considered the Beta werewolf to be family to him. This caused him to seek out a new member for his pack. He also came to Beacon Hills to seek out help combating the Argents meeting with delegations from other packs including Deucalion, Kali and Talia Hale. He was advised against it, but he declared revenge anyway, igniting the conflict between the packs and the Argents that persisted to the present. After being sought out and asked by Peter, Ennis bit Derek's girlfriend Paige to be on good terms with Talia Hale and to add a new member to his pack. After changing his mind Derek tried to save Paige, but Ennis had already bitten her. However, the bite didn't take effect, her body rejecting the transformation, causing her pain and Derek later killed her to end her suffering. Sometime after that, Ennis killed his emissary and the remaining members of his original pack to absorb their powers following Deucalion's lead, along with Kali, and with Ethan and Aiden, forming the Alpha pack.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>In the season 3 premiere, "Tattoo" he appears disguised as a hospital orderly and tried to kidnap Isaac at the hospital, only to be stopped by Derek and Scott. After breaking into Derek's loft, Ennis easily subdued Cora while Deucalion explained his proposition to Derek about joining their pack. During the Alpha pack's battle against Derek's pack in "Frayed", Ennis was severely injured by Derek and Scott, which caused Kali and Aiden, along with their emissary, Marin Morrell, to seek out Alan Deaton for help. Alan saves his life, but Deucalion kills Ennis to absorb his powers after he couldn't heal himself and lies to Kali and the twins that Ennis died from his fight with Derek. The Alpha pack states that Derek must now either be killed or he is to join their pack in repentance for Ennis' death, as per their rules. Marin tries to let the Alphas know Deucalion had actually killed Ennis also with the intention of having Kali force Derek's decision to further Deucalion's plans for Derek and Scott, but he states she's lying and Kali came for Derek anyway.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Ennis was the largest member of the Alpha pack and a force of pure brutality. His brute strength and fighting knowledge made him a deadly adversary in a fight. He was arrogant, brutal and made rather zealous, amoral actions as an Alpha werewolf, declaring revenge on the Argents for their killing his dangerous Beta and biting Paige with the intention of adding her to his pack and to be on good terms with Talia Hale. He was also quite murderous, killing his entire pack to absorb all their power. It's shown that he and Kali were involved with each other and that he followed Deucalion which is why Kali joined, according to Deucalion himself. Later, however, it was hinted Ennis felt remorse for his twisted actions when he appeared disturbed by Deucalion's speech in the episode "The Unleashed".</dd>

</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Cora is Laura and Derek's younger sister and also a born werewolf. She unknowingly survived the Hale House fire and was apparently unaware her siblings Laura and Derek were away at school at the time. Cora was long believed by Derek and Laura to be dead. After the fire, Cora ventured to South America where she lived during the intervening years. She believed her entire family was dead, but she came into town after hearing rumors an Alpha werewolf was building a pack back in Beacon Hills, California, "one of the Hales". After Boyd and Erica were captured by the Alpha pack, Cora was captured also and learned her brother Derek was alive. All three were held captive in the abandoned Beacon Hills First National Bank. During this period, Erica tried to fight back, but was killed by the Alpha werewolf Kali.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Cora became friends with Boyd during their imprisonment, but the <a href="/wiki/Moonstone_(gemstone)" title="Moonstone (gemstone)">hecatolite</a> lined in the bank vault refracted the moonlight, refraining the two werewolves from fully transforming during the full moons, causing their rage and bloodlust to build up inside. Three months later, upon being found by Derek and Scott, Cora and Boyd lost all control of their animal sides and escaped into the woods to kill. They were later subdued by Derek, with assistance from Scott, Isaac and Chris Argent. Eventually the sun rises and she and Boyd are rescued and Cora is reunited with her brother joining his pack. Cora is impulsive, trigger-happy, short tempered, vengeful and tomboyish but she cares for those close to her. Like her older brother Derek, she gives death threats to people; of course, like her older brother, she has no intention of going through with them. In "Currents", when Deaton is kidnapped to be sacrificed by the Darach, Cora helps Scott's friends to find him deducing that Deaton is being held in the same bank she was locked in for three months, but she learns the Alphas have attacked Derek's loft and sabotaged the trap for them. Cora leaves with Stiles and Lydia to help her brother. After Boyd is killed by the Alphas, she breaks down in tears and cradles her close friend's body. Cora tries to avenge his death by killing Aiden, but fails to do so and is knocked out when Aiden strikes her in the head with a weight. She is saved by Scott and Ethan when they restrain Aiden. Her wound from the blow to her head Aiden gave her suddenly doesn't heal, she falls unconscious and is put in the hospital. She was later revealed to have also been poisoned by Jennifer with mistletoe for leverage against Derek. Derek saves her life by giving up his Alpha werewolf status using his pain transference to heal her. In the mid-season 3 finale, Cora helps Lydia and Deaton save the lives of Aiden and Ethan after their defection from the Alpha pack. She later leaves Beacon Hills with Derek for her former residence in South America. During Season 3.5, Cora goes into hiding at Derek's request, remaining in South America as he undertakes a mission to retrieve their mother Talia's claws from a clan of Hispanic hunters and they separate.</dd>

</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Talia was Laura, Derek and Cora's mother, and Peter's older sister. She was an extremely powerful Alpha werewolf, with the rare ability to shapeshift into an actual wolf. As a result, Talia was treated with deep reverence by packs up and down the Pacific coast making her a leader in the larger werewolf community and had contact with Alphas Ennis, Deucalion and Kali before they formed their dangerous Alpha Pack. She and Deaton, who was her emissary, met with Deucalion concerning his proposed peace offering with the Argents. She advised him against it considering Gerard Argent's monstrous nature, but demanded that he meet Gerard on equal grounds. Talia was also a wise and caring mother as she comforted Derek after he gave his girlfriend Paige a mercy-killing to end her suffering from Ennis' Bite, saying his newly-turned blue eyes were still beautiful. She also removed Derek and Peter's memories of the Nemeton's location, ostensibly because what happened with Paige was too painful, but likely to prevent Peter from misusing it. Her children inherited her last name, showing the Hales' pack, like the Argents, had a matriarchal leadership. Her elder daughter, Laura, also had the capacity to shapeshift into an actual wolf form when she transformed and it is implied Talia taught Laura this power and also groomed Laura to succeed her as the next Alpha of the Hales. She appears in flashbacks in the episode "Visionary" in the third season. She died in the Hale House Fire.</dd>

The question Derek had for her is currently unknown, but Talia revealed to her son that the Hales didn't only live in Beacon Hills, they protected the town. In "Letharia Vulpina", Peter has Lydia listen to Talia's claws to hone in on a memory Talia had wiped from his mind before she died. Lydia hears the memory and its revealed Talia had Peter forget he'd fathered a child - the werecoyote, Malia Tate - to protect the child hinting Talia was aware of her brother's duplicitous and untrustworthy character.</dd>

In "Silverfinger", he meets Isaac posing as an arms dealer selling a rare antique gun from Chris' private collection to Katashi as a decoy for Allison and Chris to sneak into Katashi's estate. Kincaid catches onto Isaac and threateningly relays a story about the very gun to Isaac about a legendary duel between two brothers. He reveals the duel was a cover story, used for one of the brothers being bitten in the woods by something "monstrous" and by the family's code of honor the other brother put down his sibling. Ironically, Kincaid bears unsheathed werewolf claws during the entire interview. He restrains Isaac and brings him to Katashi, but when Katashi recognizes Chris, he lets Isaac go.</dd>

When they demand the finger anyway, Kincaid takes the gang on, knocking Kira and Allison aside and beating Scott down, stating that the young werewolf has the eyes of an Alpha, but lacks the strength. Ethan and Aiden overpower Kincaid and almost kill him, but Scott orders them to spare him and takes the Shugendō scroll from the prosthetic, saying they're there to "save a life, not end one".</dd>

<dd>Christopher is Allison's father and a notable werewolf hunter. Chris is a strict, no-nonsense man, and overprotective of Allison. He has a rocky relationship with Scott due to Scott's status as both a werewolf and Allison's ex-boyfriend. Unlike most of his family, Chris is generally good at heart, has a sense of honor and morality; he sticks to the Argent's hunter code and does not believe in killing the innocent. He confronts Kate about her involvement in the Hale House fire and fires a warning shot at her to have her take her gun off Scott in the season 1 finale. However, he is also very strong-minded and watchful of the werewolves. In season 2 he forces Allison and Scott to break off their relationship. He grudgingly keeps Scott safe from his father Gerard Argent, who is in town, for Allison's sake. Chris begins Allison's training to become a hunter. He shares an antagonistic relationship with Derek but does not hurt or attack his pack. Chris confronts Allison over her knowledge of the murders committed by the Kanima explaining to her that because of the fact they know of the supernatural, it is the hunters' role to protect humanity from the supernatural. When Victoria is Bitten, she asks Chris to help her commit suicide, as per the family's honor code and has to comfort Allison after his wife's death. In "Fury", Chris is reluctant to let Allison take charge of the family. He eventually follows her lead but becomes upset and cautious when Gerard corrupts her using Victoria's suicide. After Allison almost murders Erica and Boyd out of rage in "Battlefield", Chris saves their lives by shooting her bow out of her hand, horrified by the person she's becoming. In realizing that Gerard is the enemy, Chris sets Erica and Boyd free and allies with Scott, Isaac and Derek to stop Gerard in the season 2 finale.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>It is revealed in the beginning of season 3, Chris and Allison have retired from hunting to stay out of supernatural affairs. In the episode, "Fireflies", Scott goes to him for help in stopping Cora and Boyd when they are under the influence of the full moon. Chris initially refuses saying Scott's world "decimated his". After seeing a supposed victim of Boyd and Cora's rampage, he relents assisting Scott, Derek, and Isaac, in finding and capturing them. Despite saying that he has retired, he starts getting involved with the Alpha pack problem that has come to Beacon Hills. He later visits an apparently alive Gerard and learns that Alexander Argent, a past family member, was bitten by an Alpha werewolf in 1977, which led to his suicide. Gerard tells Chris that the Alpha werewolf that Bit him was Deucalion. Throughout the third season, Chris is shown to be taking part in the recent activities with the Alpha Pack and the killings by the Darach. It is later revealed that Chris has been hunting the Darach for some time and knows about Allison's involvement in helping Scott, Stiles, and Isaac. When Jennifer, who is revealed to be the Darach, names him as the next sacrifice, Chris hands himself over to keep his daughter safe and is kidnapped by her. He is later shown to be captured along with Scott's mother and Stiles's father, all three being Guardians of their children and the final sacrifice. He turns on one of his sonic emitters he uses to coral werewolves, hoping it will help them find them. He and the other parents are eventually rescued by his daughter, Isaac and Stiles. He decides to re-work the werewolf hunter's code with Allison in the mid-Season 3 finale and "protect those who cannot protect themselves", since the "beacon" inside Beacon Hills had been opened - foreshadowing an arrival of many different supernatural beings. During season 3.5, Chris is frustratingly angry when Allison begins a relationship with Isaac - "<i>another</i> werewolf!" - after he walks in on the two of them about to have sex in "Galvanize", but Isaac is attacked immediately afterward by the Oni. Chris is disturbed and relays a story to the gang in "Silverfinger". Twenty-four years earlier, at the age of 18, Gerard had Chris conduct his first gun deal leaving out the fact that the customers were Yakuza. In the middle of the deal, when the sun had set, a group of Oni attacked and killed the Yakuza boss, the kumichō, who was revealed to have been a supernatural being. Chris had survived and saved the life of a man called "Silverfinger" by shooting one of the Oni directly in the face, shattering its mask and revealing that there was nothing but darkness behind its “face.” He, Allison and Isaac later track down "Silverfinger" for information regarding the Oni and the Nogitsune, the being the Oni are after and the type of being revealed to have been was possessing the kumichō in the past. In "Letharia Vulpina", Chris and Derek are arrested by Rafael McCall under suspicion of murdering Katashi, and detained at the Sheriff's station where a bomb goes off, all arranged and committed by the Nogitsune-possessed-Stiles. Derek saves his life, shielding Chris from the blast with his body. Chris admits to Derek he's willing to use lethal force to put the Nogitsune down but he'd feel remorse if he was to kill Stiles. Stilinski has the charges against them dropped in "The Fox and the Wolf", saying he needs the two men's experience with the supernatural to help him save Stiles.</dd>

</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Gerard is Allison's grandfather, Chris and Kate's father, a lethal werewolf hunter and the main antagonist of season 2. He came to town to avenge his daughter Kate's death; he kills a defenseless Omega werewolf the hunters trapped, declares that there is no more code and that the Argents will kill all werewolves in Beacon Hills, regardless of their innocence. Gerard is ruthless, crafty, deceitful, monstrous and shows no remorse for any life he threatens or takes, even members of his own family. He goes undercover as the principal at Beacon Hills High. When Gerard finds out that Scott is a werewolf, he blackmails him into following his orders by threatening to kill Scott's mother. Scott complies supplying him with information and becoming a member in Derek's pack. Gerard heartlessly endorses that Victoria kill herself after Derek bites her and uses her death to emotionally manipulate Allison into joining him. In "Fury", Gerard kills Matt Daehler and becomes the Kanima's new Master. He then steps up as the season's main threat, threatening Melissa McCall's life again and abducting and beating Stiles as a message to Scott. In the season 2 finale, it is revealed that Gerard has cancer and all his scheming and his revenge against all werewolves was all a ruse for plans to have Derek bite him to become a werewolf and cure himself. He has the Kanima hold Allison hostage and threatens to kill her unless Scott has Derek bite him. Scott follows his orders. However, because of a plan by Scott, he and Deaton had replaced his cancer medication with mountain ash filled capsules: his body violently rejects the Bite, black blood eschewing out of his ears, eyes, nose and mouth and he is incapacitated, but he disappears, leaving his fate unknown.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>During season 3, Gerard is shown to be alive, in hiding and living at a medical institution. His cancer is now vanished, but is confined in a wheelchair and still suffering the effects of the rejected Bite from the second season, black liquid still pouring out of his orifices. He reveals to Chris that one of their family members in 1977, Alexander Argent, was bitten by the Alpha werewolf, Deucalion. In "Visionary", Allison and Scott come to him for information about Deucalion's Alpha pack in exchange for Scott siphoning away some of his pain. Gerard lies to them about Deucalion ambushing him and killing his men when they met with Deucalion's pack during Deucalion's proposed peace offering, when it was actually Gerard himself who ambushed all involved parties, killing Deucalion's pack members and killing his own men because they wanted peace with the packs (which Scott catches onto). He'd also stabbed Deucalion in the eyes with two arrows which caused Deucalion's blindness. However, he truthfully told them that while Deucalion is blind, he can actually see in his werewolf form. Scott threatens Gerard if he finds out that the story he told them about how Deucalion truly lost his eyesight was a lie and his lies get innocent people hurt, he'll come back to "take away more than (Gerard's) pain". It is because of Gerard's treachery, that Deucalion's Alpha pack was formed, and Deucalion is the person he is today.</dd>

</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Victoria was Allison's mother and Chris's wife. As a result of the matriarchal rules of the Argent family, she was technically the head of the Argent hunters, who made the final decisions, with leadership on the field being deferred to Chris. She was a rather zealous, vindictive and cold-hearted woman, giving werewolves no mercy, even with humans. She had even tortured to get what she wants as shown when she had the principal of Beacon Hills High electrocuted to have him resign so Gerard could take over as the school principal and she could take a position as a substitute teacher to keep an eye on Allison. Victoria had a very high threshold for pain. When she suspects Scott and Allison are still seeing each other after she and Chris had forbade them to, she mutilates her own arm with a kitchen knife as an excuse to ask Scott's mother Melissa questions to find out if Scott is still seeing her daughter while Melissa sews her arm up. In "Raving", she finds out Scott and Allison are still dating when she sees them kissing, so she tried to murder Scott by triggering his <a href="/wiki/Asthma" title="Asthma">asthma</a> with <a href="/wiki/Wolfsbane" title="Wolfsbane">wolfsbane</a> to keep him away from Allison. Her plan was foiled by Derek, who saved Scott and bit her in the process. In the following episode, Chris assures her the Bite isn't that bad, but she writes a goodbye letter to Allison after showing sadness that she didn't get a chance to talk to her before she took off to Lydia's party. When the next full moon's rises she feels the transformation happening, but she can't pull off her suicide by herself and asks Chris to help her. As per the Argents' honor code, Victoria commits suicide so to prevent her transforming into a werewolf. Her death causes Allison's moral spiral at the end of Season 2. Victoria's attempt to kill Scott is unknown to Allison until season 3, as Scott didn't want that to be Allison's last memory of her mother. In season 3, she appears in visions to Allison (meant to be symbolic of Allison's mental state and not a supernatural vision) and the occasional flashback.</dd>

</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Katherine "Kate" was Chris's sister and Allison's aunt, and the secondary antagonist in season 1. Kate is bloodthirsty like her father Gerard, and a proven manipulator and liar. She is also very flirtatious and rife with sexual innuendo, often using her sexuality to her advantage. She appears to be the cruelest of the hunters, and like her father, Gerard, she takes great pleasure in hurting any werewolf she can. Perhaps as a result, she did not assume a leadership role in the family as most female Argents did. She had no morals nor had any remorse for her actions. However, she was close to her niece Allison, whom she gives a necklace which depicts a wolf for her seventeenth birthday. Kate was the woman whom got chemistry teacher Adrian Harris drunk at a bar and had him reveal to her how to start a fire "and get away with arson" as Harris relayed to Sheriff Stilinski back in "Wolf's Bane", but he also draws him a necklace that Kate was wearing that night, the same necklace she gave to Allison. In "Formality", Kate reveals the supernatural world to Allison by showing her a captured Derek, all the while torturing him with an electric device. It's revealed Kate also had a sexual relationship with a younger Derek Hale simply to betray him and set the Hale House on fire. In the first season finale, Kate convinces Allison to go on the hunt for Derek and Scott after it's revealed Scott is the other Beta werewolf. She nearly kills Scott, but Chris stops her by threatening to shoot her if she doesn't put her gun down. She is eventually killed by Peter Hale as revenge for the Hale Fire. After Peter Hale is killed, the necklace is left on her corpse as evidence for her part in the Hale Fire and blaming her for Peter Hale's murder spree. During season 3.5, she appears in visions and nightmares to Allison as a result of the Allison's druid sacrifice. In the season 3.5 finale, it is revealed Kate survived after Peter ripped out her throat. She kills a group of hunters in Derek's loft before shooting Derek herself. Seeing the latter surprised to see her, she transforms into blue-skinned, fang-baring green-eyed creature called the "La-Loba".</dd>

<dd>Araya is the leader of a fellow <a href="/wiki/Hispanic" title="Hispanic">Hispanic</a> werewolf hunter clan of the Argents that were in possession of the claws of the deceased Alpha werewolf, Talia Hale. Derek and Peter Hale had come to South America to retrieve the claws from them but the clan captured the two werewolves. Araya calls off her subordinates when they are torturing the two captive wolves and interrogates them herself. She trades words with Derek in Spanish, then demands to know the location of "the she-wolf" (presumably she means Cora). She smugly admits that Derek won't talk, so she moves onto Peter and demands the same question. When Peter remains silent, she takes a blade - and lacerates Peter's right ring finger leaving him screaming in agony. Araya and her subordinates leaves them be, but tells them she was only going to ask him "nine more times".</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Araya arrives in Beacon Hills at the Sheriff's station in "Echo House", pretending to be Chris Argent's lawyer when he is arrested for suspicion of murder, where he shows wary alertness at her presence. Araya states her disappointment with his family's new more humanitarian hunter's code. She supplements this statement with her belief that Victoria honored them by committing suicide upon being bitten (presumably Araya was referring to her own clan implying Victoria had a tie to them). Chris shows defiance telling Araya she would have honored Allison by staying alive. Araya leaves without revealing what she is up to. When Chris asks her what she's "fishing for", she replies: "I don't fish: I hunt".</dd>

<dd>Danny was Jackson's best friend, and is on relatively good terms with Stiles and Scott. His last name is <a href="/wiki/Hawaiian_language" title="Hawaiian language">Hawaiian</a> for "full moon". He is one of the Beacon Hills High in-crowd and is openly gay. He is the goalie on the lacrosse team and is also in the school band (trumpet). Danny often tries to calm Jackson down when he was angry or irritated. He also seems to have befriended Scott and Stiles in indirect ways. Stiles often wonders aloud if Danny finds him attractive, comments which Danny usually ignores, but once returns by snidely offering to sleep with Stiles. He remains totally in the dark about the supernatural events and beings plaguing the town.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>In season 2, he helps Jackson recover lost footage from his camera which Jackson shot for his first full moon transformation with help from Matt Daehler whom he is attracted to, but does't act on his attraction realising he's into Allison. He is shown to be depressed over his separation from his ex-boyfriend, Damon at a gay club, Jungle. Presumably, because the Kanima's Master wanted to remove any evidence, Danny is attacked at a gay club, but is only paralysed by the Kanima in the episode "Frenemy" and the footage Danny recovered from Jackson's video vanished. In the episode, "Battlefield", he is warned by Jackson to not get anywhere near him during the lacrosse finals game, most likely because Jackson is somehow aware he is the Kanima and killing people.</dd>

<dd>In season 3, he develops an interest in Ethan,<sup id="cite_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-10"><span>[</span>10<span>]</span></a></sup> unaware that Ethan was originally using him to get to Scott. Although Danny doesn't realize it, his relationship with Ethan softens the werewolf to the point where he is willing to change for the better, even going as far as helping Scott and Stiles thwart Deucalion's plans. In episode 7 "Currents", Danny is lethally poisoned with <a href="/wiki/Mistletoe" title="Mistletoe">mistletoe</a> by the Darach and his lung collapses. Ethan, obviously excessively worried about Danny, helps him to the hospital, where Melissa McCall saves his life using a <a href="/wiki/Pneumothorax" title="Pneumothorax">needle thoracostomy</a>. It's revealed Danny was targeted because he did a project on <a href="/wiki/Telluric_currents" title="Telluric currents" class="mw-redirect">telluric currents</a> which were placed on the locations of where the Darach was sacrificing his victims. Despite the fact that Ethan was only supposed to manipulate Danny's feelings to gain information, as Aiden had been assigned to do with Lydia, he eventually fell in love with Danny and is shown to have several tender moments with him. However, in season 3.5, after their separation and Ethan and Aiden decide to re-enroll in high school, Danny is shown making out with Damon, his ex, which Ethan is clearly upset about, to Aiden's amusement. In "Illuminated", because of the power outage, Danny wants to hold a black light party, but is cut down. Ethan and Aiden help him out by acquiring a power generator and letting him use Derek's loft for the party. Danny is very pleased with the results and bonds with Ethan again. In "Letharia Vulpina", Danny is seen with the cross country team on the track where traps are laid by the Nogitsune and Ethan tackles him to protect him and says he missed Danny and proceeds to make out with him. When Coach Finstock is shot by an arrow triggered by a trip wire, Danny looks on while Ethan stays protectively beside him.

Scott is very close to his mother, epspecially since his father is no longer in the picture. However, Melissa argued with Adrian Harris in season 1 that neither Scott nor she feels the need of a male figure in the house. She is asked out on her first date in a long time in "Co-Captain". But her date turns out to none other than Peter Hale, who intends to turn her with the intention to convince Scott to join his pack. Scott sabotages the date to save her. In "Formality", she is shown to be upset over the failed date. She later helps Scott get ready for the school formal and unknowingly gives her son the confidence he needs to tell Allison he's a werewolf.</dd>

<dd>In season 2, Gerard Argent threatens her life to blackmail Scott into following his orders. In "Restraint" after Jackson files a restraining order against Scott and Stiles, she angrily confronts Scott over all of his bizarre behavior and concernedly asks are his actions are because of his absent father. To keep her in the dark, Scott affirms this. In episode "Fury", she is called to the Sheriff's station as a witness, but as she arrives she sees Matt, the Kanima's Master, shoot her son in the stomach and is held hostage with Stilinski, leaving her horrified. Later she witnesses Derek Hale fight the Kanima learning about the supernatural and finally sees Scott in his werewolf form. At first, she is shocked and has trouble coping, avoiding Scott for a week and is even more frightened when Gerard breaks in and has the Kanima hold her hostage. Eventually, she comes to accept Scott for what he is and encourages him to help others with his abilities. In season 3, she is shown to be helping Scott cover up any evidence of werewolves, even when Isaac is admitted to the hospital after being attacked by Alpha werewolves, she tries to help smuggle him out. She even helps Stiles identify a new killer in Beacon Hills by allowing him access to the morgue. In the episode, "The Overlooked", Melissa helps Scott and his allies with their plan to help Jennifer, who is revealed to be the Darach, escape the Alphas (Jennifer had poisoned Cora and kidnapped Stilinski for leverage), but Jennifer double-crosses them and kidnaps Melissa. Melissa is later held in the Nemeton along with Stiles' and, later, Allison's fathers for the final sacrifice.

After that she comforts and promises him that people fall in love more than once. Melissa continues in assisting in the events that take place bringing Scott the serial killer William Barrow's clothes so Scott and the other werewolves can lock onto his scent in "Galvanize" and having her house installed with ash wood base boards with Deaton's help to work as a security system against the supernatural which she arms when the Oni attack the house.</dd>

<dd>The Sheriff is Stiles's father and the sheriff of Beacon Hills. Like Stiles, his first name is unknown. He is an intelligent and dedicated officer, although his ability to do his job is hampered by his unawareness of the supernatural forces behind many of the crimes in Beacon Hills. Stilinski and Stiles are mutually supportive and protective of one another, in part because of the death of Stiles' mother, Claudia, some years before the beginning of the series. In season 1, Stilinski links the murders committed by the Alpha werewolf to the Hale House fire. He discovers an accomplice in the arson, Adrian Harris, who gave him the lead to the girl he drunkenly babbled to about how someone could start a fire and get away with arson - a necklace with a wolf on it. In the first season finale, he finds the body of Kate Argent with the necklace, linking her to the crimes. In season 2, he is again working on solving a killing spree. He is put on temporary leave because of Stiles' behavior throughout the season, straining his relationship with his son. With Stiles' help, he finds out the victims were a part of the Beacon Hills High 2006 swim team. He is held hostage at the Sheriff's station with Melissa and their sons by Matt, when they uncover evidence convicting Matt. After the events are resolved, he is reinstated as Sheriff.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>In season, 3 Stilinski again has a murder spree on his hands in season 3, this time committed by the Darach. Stiles is reluctant to let his father in on the supernatural business out of fear he could be killed. Eventually in the episode "The Girl Who Knew Too Much", he attempts to tell Stilinski the truth using previous experiences, but Stilinski says he doesn't know what he's seen, harshly trying to end the argument. Stiles talks back, saying, "Mom would've believed me." Stilinski uncovers information on a hunch about the supernatural and counters Jennifer Blake about to kill Lydia and comes face to face with her true form, the Darach and Scott in his werewolf form. Jennifer takes him for the guardians' sacrifice. He is held in the Nemeton along with Melissa McCall and Chris Argent. He is now brought up with the supernatural. In "Alpha Pact", he relays a story eight years ago. He was helping a girl who was stuck in a car accident holding her hand. She'd comforted him if his wife was dying he should go be with her. He didn't waiting for paramedics to arrive. Claudia had died when he arrived and Stiles had been with her. If he'd believed in the supernatural, believed that the girl psychically knew that Claudia was dying, he would've been with his wife in her final moments. He and the parents are rescued by Allison and Isaac just as Jennifer is sacrificing them supernaturally using the storm to bury them. Stiles arrives holding up the ceiling of the root cellar with an aluminum bat and is reunited with his son. After this episode, Stilinski starts to search through old cases which he suspect could involve a supernatural creature, particularly the case of Malia Tate. He asks Scott to help him to find some clue in Malia's house, but this proves to be unsuccessful. Later, Stiles admit to Scott this action was his last attempt to solve some case when he's still the sheriff, since Rafael, Scott's father is having Sheriff Stilinski impeached for a "lack of resolution and ability to close cases". However, with Scott and Stiles' help in the following episode "More Bad than Good", Malia Tate was found alive and he reunites her with her father and Stilinski closes the case in Rafael's face. It is hinted that Rafael and Stilinski have a history of conflict and revealed that Stiles' father is aware of something Rafael doesn't like him knowing. Stilinski temporarily puts his dislike of Rafael aside in "Riddled" when he finds Stiles after he goes missing and shakes his hand in gratitude. Stilinski has been taking notes of Stiles' growing symptoms and has him undergo a test for the same disease that killed Claudia. When he sees a brain scan similar to his wife's, he is visibly shaken.</dd>

He was questioned by Sheriff Stilinski in season 1, regarding the murderous events that take place, which subsequently reveals that six years ago, he gave information to a woman on how to set a house on fire and make it look like it was not an act of arson after she got him drunk. He also reveals that a few days after he gave this information, a house caught on fire and was burned down (the Hale family murder). The woman he gave information to is revealed to be Kate Argent. In Season 2, Harris was believed to be the Kanima's Master, because his car was stolen by the Master and was identified to be at the presence of several of the murder sites. He was proven innocent by Stiles and Scott.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>During Season 3, in episode "Unleashed", it's revealed he was a former military officer and so he was sacrificed as a warrior. Before he was taken, he left behind a clue to the gang in his test papers allowing Deaton to identify the killer as a Darach. He begged for his life, saying the Darach still needs him. He knew who and also about this person's motives, but the Darach kills him. Later in "Currents", the gang uncovers Danny's proposed <a href="/wiki/Telluric_current" title="Telluric current">telluric currents</a> project for Harris along with a note to Danny from Harris to stay away from the subject. This allows them to figure out the Darach's abductions and sacrifices are aligned with the tell uric currents around Beacon Hills and that Harris wasn't only sacrificed, he knew something. It's implied that eventually his body was found off-screen since Sheriff Stilinski had labeled him when he's investigating possible supernatural explanations of some crimes.</dd>

<dd>Matt was a student at Beacon Hills High, a photographer and was also on the lacroose team. He stalked Allison throughout season 2 and was the secondary antagonist of season 2. He was the Kanima's first Master. In the second season premiere, "Omega", he takes pictures of Allison at Kate Argent's funeral, but is accosted by Gerard Argent who destroys his camera's memory card. In episode "Shape-Shifted" he lends Jackson a night-vision camera for Jackson to record his expected full moon transformation. He notices a strange flash in each of his photo shots of Scott McCall in the episode "Venomous" (caused by Scott's uncontrolled werewolf eyes which were triggered by the flash of his camera). In "Restraint", he steals a translated portion of the bestiary depicting the Kanima from Allison's tablet. He takes Allison out on a date to a warehouse party in "Raving", unaware that Allison was only using him to throw her parents off her back about staying away from Scott, where he kisses her, but Allison finds out he's a stalker upon finding his many inappropriate photos of her. In "Party Guessed", she confronts him about his photos, but when his behavior annoys her, she judo-flips him. Later on he is seen, by Scott, with Jackson in his Kanima state revealing Matt's the Kanima's Master.</dd>

<dd>In 2006, nine-year-old Matt had gone to Isaac Lahey's house to trade superhero comic books with him. The swim team of Beacon Hills High at that time was having a pool party at the house and drinking alcohol to celebrate their winning the state championship. Matt was thrown into the pool by Camden, Isaac's older brother, despite yelling that he can't swim, resulting in him almost drowning. He was resuscitated by Coach Lahey who berates him about not knowing how to swim and demands he tell no one what happened. Matt obliged keeping the incident secret, causing himself trauma and having irregular nightmares where he's drowning.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Back during the Argents' funeral, when he was photographing Allison, Lahey had got in one of his shots. Matt'd felt an unbelievable rage for his near-drowning years earlier and wished that Lahey was dead. The following morning he found out Lahey <i>was</i> dead. In "Shape-Shifted" he'd spied on Jackson using his camera and witnessed his transformation into the Kanima. He and the Kanima touched hands seemingly by instinct. Through a supernatural bond that formed between the two of them he saw that Jackson had killed Lahey for him and Matt became Master of the Kanima. He used the Kanima to murder all members of the swim team who were involved in the incident, except for Jessica whom he killed directly.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>In "Fury", at the Sheriff's station, Matt has Jackson murder all the deputies on night shift, destroys all the evidence linking him to the murders and takes Scott, Stiles, Derek, Stilinski and Melissa hostage. He reveals he knows all about the supernatural events occurring and demands Scott hand over the bestiary. He needed answers as to why he was beginning to transform into the Kanima, but Derek silently realized Matt had broken the rules of the Kanima. The Master is to <i>use</i> the Kanima to kill <i>murderers</i>, while Matt had him kill innocent people and he had killed Jessica Bartlet directly. The hunters attack the building and in the struggle between the Argents, Jackson, and Scott and Derek, Matt escapes but Gerard kills him by drowning him, using this opportunity to become the Kanima's new Master.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>As a result of his childhood trauma, Matt became a teenage killer, psychologically unstable, dangerous. He irrationally called Lahey and the swim team murderers because they 'murdered' him. He was also a stalker, relentlessly pursuing Allison by taking photos of her and photo shopping himself into these pictures depicting they were in a relationship. As Master of the Kanima, Matt gained abilities to control the Kanima through a supernatural bond. He could communicate with Jackson <a href="/wiki/Telepathy" title="Telepathy">telepathically</a>, control Jackson even in his human form, <a href="/wiki/Empathy" title="Empathy">sense</a> him from a distance and even <a href="/wiki/Mental_projection" title="Mental projection">speak through</a> him. The bond between Master and the Kanima was affected akin to Matt's personality; his <a href="/wiki/Aquaphobia" title="Aquaphobia">fear of water</a>, for instance. Jackson, in his Kanima form would share his aqua phobia. The bond was also affected by his affinity for photography: to target a victim, Matt realized he just had to take their picture or think about killing them, then Jackson would kill them.</dd>

He was abusive to his younger son, Isaac, torturing him by often locking him in the basement freezer. In the season two premiere, he makes fun of Isaac when interrogated by Sheriff Stilinski, and also attacks Isaac during dinner. He is later murdered by the Kanima, which sets Isaac on the quest to become part of Derek's pack and get the confidence and power he lacked. Even after all the abuse and his death, Isaac still has fond memories of him, as his father was Isaac's emotional anchor for gaining control during the full moon. In "Fury", it's revealed the swim team had won a state championship and Lahey had invited the team over his house for a pool party and have some drinks to celebrate. Matt reveals that Lahey had rescued him from drowning in the pool when he was nine. Lahey had cruelly berated Matt about not knowing how to swim and made him tell no one about the incident at his house (as he would've got in trouble if it was revealed he was letting the swim team drink alcohol). It's revealed that Matt's anger at Lahey for the incident caused Jackson to shift into his Kanima form and kill Lahey (the Kanima seeks a Master that desires vengeance on others to control the creature).</dd>

They both hint to knowing each other. Later on, Stiles tells Scott that his "dad's in town", revealing Rafael to be Agent McCall. While it was implied throughout the run of the show (via Melissa's response to Adrian Harris' question about Scott's relationship with his father in season 1, her asking Scott if his actions are in relation to his father during season 2, as well as Stiles' negative reaction to the sight and questions of McCall during season 3) that he is a jerk and deadbeat, he is shown sitting in Scott's room with teary eyes, implying that whatever his flaws are, he cares a great deal about his former family (or at least his son). In the mid-Season 3 finale, Rafael insensitively reunites with Scott at Allison's house and interrogates them along with Isaac about the mysterious events surrounding the gang and the numerous weapons seen in the Argent household. Allison allows them to escape by setting off a smoking grenade. At the end of season 3A, Rafael is seen trying to reconcile with Scott to no avail, which Melissa finds amusing.</dd>

Rafael assists in security and later, the search when mass murderer William Barrow is turfed to Beacon Hills Memorial and escapes during his surgery. In episode 16 of season 3, "Illuminated", Stiles coldly lets Rafael know that Agent McCall's attitude towards his father is because of some other so-far-unknown factor rather than his "professional disapproval" of Stilinski, something Agent McCall isn't comfortable with Stilinski knowing and Stiles says he knows what it is.

When Stiles goes missing from sleepwalking in "Riddled", Rafael picks up on a line from Stiles' phone message to Scott and correctly deduces Stiles is sleepwalking, had called Scott while still asleep and is at the werecoyote's den. Stilinski puts aside his differences with Rafael when he finds Stiles and brings him to the hospital, shaking his hand. When Stilinski faces his board review for the impeachment case in "De-Void", Rafael helps to talk the Sheriff out of the case, revealing to him the real reason he came was to have an excuse to stay so he could talk to Scott over what went down between the two men and Melissa.</dd>

<li><b>Alan Deaton</b> (<a href="/wiki/Seth_Gilliam" title="Seth Gilliam">Seth Gilliam</a>) (Seasons 1 - 3)</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Alan is the <a href="/wiki/Veterinary_physician" title="Veterinary physician">veterinarian</a> at Beacon Hills Animal Hospital and Scott's employer. Alan is like a father to Scott as his real father, Rafael, is a deadbeat parent. During Season 1, Sheriff Stilinski goes to him for info when the murders are implied to be animal attacks. Alan, however, apparently knows more than he let's on. Derek Hale suspects him to be the murderous Alpha werewolf in the episode "Heart Monitor", but it's later revealed that Derek's uncle Peter Hale is the Alpha. In "Co-Captain", after Scott is shot with a wolfsbane laced bullet by Kate Argent, Alan finds Scott and treats him revealing that aside from working with animals, he also works with werewolves, healing them when they are injured. In "Formality", Alan remains calm and collected when Peter Hale, the Alpha werewolf arrives for Scott. Peter is repelled by the clinic's balustrade is made of <a href="/wiki/Sorbus_aucuparia" title="Sorbus aucuparia">mountain ash</a>. In season 2, Scott tries to ask him how he knows about the supernatural in the episode "Ice Pick", but Alan deflects him. Later in the season he helps Scott, Stiles, and Derek and his pack against the Kanima. Alan is later shown to be an associate of Ms Morrell, the school guidance counselor and French teacher, who confronts Alan over the wisdom of having Scott and his allies dealing with the current situation and "what's coming". Alan reveals to Derek that he had been a trusted adviser and helper to the Hale family for a long time and that he made a promise to Derek's mother that he would help Derek and look after him if anything were to happen to her. Alan helped Scott prepare the mountain ash laced pills to swap with Gerard's cancer medication when Scott figured out Gerard's plan to be Bitten by Derek. In the season 2 finale, after Gerard's plan fails, he and Morrell begin tracking him, Morrell saying she's glad he's out of retirement. It is revealed that the upcoming threat that Alan and Morrell mentioned was an Alpha pack.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>In season 3 Alan has taken on a mentor-like figure to Scott and his allies, lending advice on the supernatural. In the episode "Chaos Rising", using an ice bath to put Isaac under hypnosis, he helps Isaac remember where Boyd and Erica are being held the night he found them. In the episode "Unleashed", Stiles comes to him concerning a new killer committing human sacrifices, having linked the sacrifices to the Celtic druids and that he always seems to have more information than anyone else. When Stiles demands why he's always withdrawing and always acting so cryptic, Alan alludes to have had a dark past that presumably caused him to go into retirement when he answers to have spent the past decade "trying to push something away" with the lies and the denial, that it could have a powerful effect on someone. When Lydia calls saying the music teacher has been taken for to be sacrificed he helps Stiles and Lydia identify the new killer as a 'Darach'. He also identifies the pattern of the sacrifices of being groups of three offering the Darach its own type of power - Virgins, Healers, Philosophers, Warriors. In "Frayed", he is forced to help Deucalion's Alpha pack heal one of their own, after they threatened to strike back hard against Derek's pack including Scott. He concernedly chastises Marin Morrell saying he believes she doesn't know what she got herself into with her involvement with Deucalion after the Alpha pack leader kills Ennis anyway. It's revealed he is actually Marin's older brother. It is discovered that Alan and Marin are both emissaries, druid practitioners, that function as advisers to the werewolf packs and ambassadors between them and humanity. Alan fulfilled this role for the Hale family, and was especially close to Derek's mother, Talia Hale. In "Alpha Pact", he helps Scott, Stiles and Allison find their parents, by proposing they take a dangerous druid ritual in order to locate the Nemeton which will have consequences on all three of them, leaving a mental "scar" around their hearts which they'll have for the rest of their lives and being substitute 'Guardian' sacrifices for the parents which will fully revitalize the Nemeton, attracting supernatural beings to Beacon Hills like a magnet. They decide to do it, to sacrifice themselves temporarily with someone close to them to pull them back as a tether. Alan fulfilled this role for Scott. In the mid-season 3 premiere "Anchors", Scott and Stiles come to Alan concerning their and Allison's psychological issues as a result of their druid sacrifice. He informs them that when they died and subsequently resurrected, they essentially opened 'a door in their minds' which is still ajar. He tells them an opening into their minds is dangerous, that they each need to close that 'door'. When it's revealed the Nogitsune is possessing Stiles, Deaton heads to Japan in "Letharia Vulpina", to retrieve a sample of a plant called letharia vulpina that was born out of the blood of the very Nogitsune Chris Argent saw killed twenty-four years earlier, which makes the plant "quite special". Upon arriving back in Beacon Hills, he poisons Stiles with the plant which temporarily breaks the Nogitsune's hold over Stiles. After Scott retrieves the Shugendō scroll in "Echo House", which contains instructions on how to exorcise a Nogitsune, Deaton translates that the host's body has to be changed to remove the spirit, but he admits his Japanese is rusty. In the season 3 finale, "The Divine Move", Deaton confirms that the Hales' triskele box could trap the Nogitsune's essence because it was crafted by Deaton himself, out of wood of the Nemeton tree. After the threats pass, Deaton provides Scott counsel with the fallacy "Regression to the Mean", saying things will stop being all bad, or all good and always revert to a neutral space.</dd>

</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Marin is the guidance counselor and French teacher at Beacon Hills High. Throughout season 2, she counseled both Stiles and Lydia through various traumas and helped Allison translate an entry in the Argent's bestiary. It's sporadically implied, and confirmed in "Raving", that she is aware of the supernatural side of things when she is seen conversing with Deaton concerning the Kanima situation and leaving it all up to Scott and his allies. She asks Alan is he going to inform them "what's coming". At the end of Season 2, she convinces Alan to get more involved in the supernatural goings-on of Beacon Hills and the two start tracking Gerard after his plan fails. It is revealed at the beginning of season 3 that she is somehow involved with Deucalion, the Alpha pack leader. It is later discovered that she is actually Alan's younger sister and that they are both practitioner druids called emissaries that act as advisers to werewolf packs, keeping them connected to humanity and she supposedly fulfills this role for Deucalion's Alpha pack. It is revealed that Marin was originally the emissary for Deucalion's pack and was the only one spared when the Alpha werewolves killed their packs and their emissaries. In the episode "The Girl Who Knew Too Much", Scott confronts her asking her what Deucalion wants with him. She says he wants to make a killer out of him, because if Scott kills someone he'll destroy his potential to be a True Alpha or have Scott join his pack, either way Scott is eliminated as a threat to Deucalion. In "Alpha Pact", after the Darach is revealed to be Jennifer Blake, she is seen fleeing from the Alpha pack in the woods but protects herself with a <a href="/wiki/Sorbus_aucuparia" title="Sorbus aucuparia">mountain ash circle</a>. The Alphas had suspected her to have had a role to play with the Darach. Marin confronts Deucalion over his ruthlessness in his attempts to form his 'perfect pack', that she'd begun to try and stop him. Kali tells her they know she sent the mystery woman to save Isaac and had begun helping Scott and his friends find a way to stop Deucalion. Marin reveals the woman's name was Braeden, that she'd sent Braeden to do what Marin herself does, "maintain balance" and reveals to the other Alphas that Alan had actually saved Ennis, but Deucalion killed him and lied to them about it being Derek who'd killed him. She tries to tell Kali he intended for her to force Derek's decision to join the pack, because that paves the way for Deucalion's plans for him and Scott. Deucalion states she's lying and injures her with his cane but Scott saves her and she tells him where they can find the location of the last Druid massacre, the Nemeton.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>In season 3B, Marin appears in "Echo House", as a counselor at Eichen House, a mental hospital. She acts as Stiles's contact when he voluntarily checks himself in at the institution to prevent the Nogitsune from harming anyone. Marin leads group therapy, which includes Stiles and Malia, discussing the subject of guilt, where Stiles and Malia offer input on the feeling because of the Nogitsune possessing him and Malia over her changing on a full moon causing the death of her mother and little sister. Marin cuts the session short when she notices the electric burn marks on Stiles's neck, the site where Alan had injected the wolf lichen. Marin supplies Stiles with <a href="/wiki/Amphetamine" title="Amphetamine">amphetamines</a> to keep him awake and makes it clear that she will kill him by lethal injection if the Nogitsune returns and Scott and Alan haven't found a cure to "maintain balance". After the Nogitsune returns and escapes Eichen, Marin tells Malia where to find Scott so she can join in the hunt for Stiles.</dd>

<li><b>Jennifer Blake</b> (<a href="/wiki/Haley_Webb" title="Haley Webb">Haley Webb</a>) (Season 3)</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Jennifer was the new English teacher at Beacon Hills High School. She was proven to be the Darach and one of the main antagonists of season 3. In the season three premiere, "Tattoo", she begins her class with the last quote from Joseph Conrad's "Heart of Darkness". Suddenly, flocks of birds mysteriously come flying through the window and begin attacking the class. She is seen mildly distressed afterward. In "Fireflies", she's seen late at school grading papers, when she happens across a feral Boyd and Cora, but she is saved by Derek who endures their attacks until the sun rises. Derek helps her up and she supposedly takes a liking to him. She sees Derek again in "Unleashed", where she says she'll say nothing about what she saw. Derek says he was going to see if she was okay and they connect. When Derek comes to her for help, after being wounded by Deucalion's Alpha pack, she takes him to his loft in "Motel California" and tries to help him heal. Jennifer and Derek connect again with him saying she shouldn't get involved with him, because everyone around him gets hurt, but she says she's been hurt before. They share a kiss and spend the night together, which helps Derek heal faster. When the Alphas attack his loft in "Currents", Kali has the twins hold her hostage as leverage against Derek and she witnesses Derek, in his Alpha werewolf form, and Kali fight. She is saved by Isaac but Kali has Derek kill Boyd.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>In the episode "The Girl Who Knew Too Much", Jennifer is taking a class and sees Lydia drawing a tree. Later, she organizes the recital to honor the dead. Sheriff Stilinski simultaneously uncovers an old case about a patient who was brought to Beacon Hills Memorial years ago, but birds, similarly to the events in "Tattoo" died that day with Stilinski realizing the birds were sacrificing themselves for the girl - who he figures out to actually be Jennifer. Jennifer is realized to be the Darach, the dark druid responsible for the mass sacrifices in Beacon Hills and tries to kill Lydia and kidnaps Stilinski. Using <a href="/wiki/Mistletoe" title="Mistletoe">mistletoe</a> Scott and Stiles prove to Derek she is the Darach in the episode "The Overlooked", by exposing her true form. Derek angrily attacks her, but she reveals she's poisoned his sister Cora with the same plant and only she can heal her. As the Alpha pack try to kill her, she shows her intense hatred for them. She reveals to Derek her first name was <b>Julia Baccari</b> and that she was Kali's emissary. She and Kali were close, but Kali had attempted to kill her, as part of killing her entire pack in order to join Deucalion's Alpha pack. She was barely able to survive because Kali couldn't bring herself to deliver the killing blow, but Julia then struggled to the Nemeton, which hadn't had power for a long time. But the sacrifice of a virgin months earlier had given the tree stump a spark of power again, which gave Julia the ability to survive just long enough until help arrived. Eventually, because Kali's attack had left Julia hideously disfigured, she used her abilities to disguise herself with a new identity, 'Jennifer Blake'. She informs him of her plan to destroy Deucalion's Alpha pack on the next full moon which is also a lunar eclipse because werewolves lose all their power during the eclipse. Derek affirms this. She also reveals to him that the virgin sacrificed at the Nemeton that reignited its power was Paige Krasikeva, his first love when Derek mercy-killed her, explaining her felt connection towards him. In "Alpha Pact", Jennifer holds Stiles' father, along with Scott's mother and Allison's father for the final sacrifice, Guardians, as they are all guardians of their children. The behavior of the animals throughout the season is later discovered to have been caused by Jennifer in response to her and her mass sacrifices. She is also discovered to be aligned with the <a href="/wiki/Telluric_current" title="Telluric current">telluric currents</a> as she committed her sacrifices in line with them. It is also discovered that she's holding the captive parents at the Nemeton, the same tree in Lydia's been consistently drawing throughout season 3 which is why Jennifer tried to kill her.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>In the mid-season finale, "Lunar Ellipse", she appears at Derek's loft, breaking through the glass roof and takes on the Alpha pack. She overpowers Kali and the twins. She angrily faces Kali, asking her what it takes for to look normal to spite Kali as she'd physically ruined her actual face. Jennifer demonstrates her power using telekinesis to have the glass shards rise and suspend. Kali stubbornly rages at her former friend and Jennifer ferociously rockets the glass shards into Kali's body, killing her former Alpha. The twins then take her on in their merged form but she snaps their neck inducing them into a coma. She uses Lydia to lure Derek back to his loft. She promises Derek the kidnapped parents if he will be her "Guardian", even after he informs her he's no longer an Alpha werewolf. Jennifer begins sacrificing the parents using the storm to bury them alive with her connection to the telluric currents. At the abandoned distillery outside of Beacon Hills, they face off against Deucalion who has Scott with him. Deucalion easily overpowers both of them, but, to buy more time, Scott blinds the "Demon Wolf" long enough for the lunar eclipse to arrive and the werewolves are rendered powerless. Jennifer assumes her true form and thrashes Deucalion. Derek convinces her to heal his blindness so he can see the results of his actions on her with the intent of him repenting her. However, this leaves Jennifer weakened as Derek had intended. Enraged, Jennifer repeatedly assaults Derek, but he endures her attacks just long enough for the lunar eclipse to pass. The lunar eclipse passes, but Jennifer protects herself with a mountain ash barrier, now fully intent on sacrificing the parents. To save them, Scott determinedly pushes through her barrier and eventually breaks it becoming a True Alpha. Scott says he'll kill her himself if she doesn't stop the storm, but Deucalion does it mortally wounding her. Later it was revealed she survived Deucalion's slash to the throat, and was hoping the Nemeton would restore her health one more time - only to be stopped by Peter Hale. After revealing she knows all about his plan (killing Scott to steal his new Alpha status), he slashes her throat himself, thus seemingly finishing her off. In an interview with Jeff Davis, it has been hinted that she may return in a later season.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Jennifer/Julia was highly intelligent, specializing in literature and mythology, as expected of a druid emissary. She had an intense hatred for Deucalion's Alpha pack, specifically Kali as she was friends with her and Kali tried to kill her and she stopped at nothing to get revenge on them. As the Darach, Jennifer was amongst the most powerful beings seen in the series because of her mass druid sacrifices. By massacring 'Warriors', she gained <a href="/wiki/Superhuman_strength" title="Superhuman strength" class="mw-redirect">enhanced strength</a>, 'Healers' for <a href="/wiki/Energy_healing" title="Energy healing" class="mw-redirect">healing abilities</a> so great she healed Deucalion's blindness, 'Philosophers' for intelligence and strategy, and 'Virgins', supposedly to seduce people easily for her goals as with Derek. She could use telekinesis and she use a form of <a href="/wiki/Mind_control" title="Mind control">mind control</a> to have a pianist killed by a split random cord off the piano to slit her throat for her final 'Philosopher' sacrifice. She could glamor herself to disguise her disfigured form and hide in plain sight so efficiently she settled into her "Jennifer Blake" persona for the majority of the time fooling many people she was a harmless, defenceless woman. She could even <a href="/wiki/Apport_(paranormal)" title="Apport (paranormal)">appear somewhere else partially or teleport completely</a> as seen when she abducted victims and as Lydia saw her materialize in a blaze in "Motel California".</dd>

</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Noshiko is Kira's mother and Mr. Yukimura's wife. Noshiko is of Japanese descent and like her daughter, Noshiko is a kitsune, though unlike her daughter, she is not a Thunder kitsune. She is the only surviving member of her family and claims to be nearly 900 years old. She and her husband were married in Japan, with Mr. Yukimura taking his wife's name, as Japanese law requires that the couple must take the same single name to belong to the same Koseki (family registry). She has family ties to Beacon Hills; she claims her lineage is well respected in Japan as she tells her daughter, Kira, that she should be proud of her family line.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Noshiko meets Scott in "Galvanize" when her husband invites him over for a sushi dinner when Scott and Kira have an interest in each other and is quite proud of her husband's culinary skills. In "Riddled", Noshiko replaces a light bulb for Kira's room but unintentionally displays abilities similar to Kira's, bleeding out electrical currents into the new bulb through her finger tips. Kira is instantly stunned and suspicious of her mother. Noshiko appears at the hospital during the power surge, seemingly unconcerned by the electrical outage. She faces Stiles Stilinski who is possessed by the Nogitsune. Noshiko also appears to be able to summon and command the Oni. Noshiko and the Nogitsune trade words revealing she knows it and that she will eliminate the dark kitsune, letting it know she will be undeterred in stopping it even if its chosen host is an innocent teenager. She says she knows someone who can destroy it even if the Oni can't. Later, however Noshiko sees Kira manifest her kitsune abilities absorbing a sabotaged electric wire and lets her know she saw what happened. She barely says a word to Kira over the next two days. In "Letharia Vulpina", she meets with her husband discreetly during the bomb scare at school, unaware that Kira is spying on them. She takes two blades out of a container sized book he hands her and breaks them in half releasing an ominous-looking smoke. Noshiko and her husband refer to the blades as her "tails" and its revealed that she can create the Oni by sacrificing the blades when two Oni, more powerful than the previous five, are released from the Nemeton from her two newly broken blades.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>In "The Fox and the Wolf" Noshiko reveals to her daughter and Scott that she is responsible for unleashing the Nogitsune. In 1943, Noshiko was living in a "<a href="/wiki/Japanese_American_Internment" title="Japanese American Internment" class="mw-redirect">relocation camp</a>" called Camp Oak Creek, subtly improving the lives of the interned Japanese Americans by stealing extra supplies while engaged in a clandestine romance with a field medic, Corporal Rhys. During a devastating outbreak of pneumonia, Noshiko and Rhys discovered that the camp doctor and Rhys' underlings, Merrick and Hayes, were selling medical supplies on the black market, resulting in several deaths in the camp. Noshiko hastily told her fellow interns of her discovery, but her actions had unintentionally incited a riot on the camp grounds between the officers and the interns. During the chaos, Noshiko looked on in horror at the anger. Rhys had attempted to break up the riot but was set ablaze by a Molotov cocktail thrown by an intern, Satomi, who Noshiko realized too late was a werewolf. Eventually the officers opened fire and which dozens of people (including Noshiko) were shot and Rhys died in agony (the doctor having also sold the morphine). Apparently dead, but incapacitated and healing, Noshiko learned the incident was going to be covered up and she was enraged the army medics were going to get away with mass murder and distraught with Rhys' death. Seething with injustice, Noshiko prayed for her ancestors to send a Nogitsune to punish those responsible for the massacre, intending for the being to possess her; being a trickster, however, the Nogitsune possessed Rhys' corpse and proceeded to slaughter the doctor, the G.I.s, and even the Japanese Americans at Eichen House. Realizing her great mistake and seeing the bloodbath she had brought upon, Noshiko eventually cornered the Nogitsune and, with some unexpected help from Satomi, slew it, but her katana was shattered in the process. Noshiko had buried the fly from its body which encapsulated the Nogitsune's very being near the Nemeton (then still standing). After Scott and Kira head off to deal with the Nogitsune, Noshiko reveals the reason they came back to Beacon Hills was because the ritual Allison, Stiles and Scott undertook released the demon from its prison. Later, Noshiko visits Rhys' grave in the Eichen House's basement in "De-Void". Its revealed she had carved the kanji "self" into the board to signify that Rhys had died as himself, not as a monster. In "Insatiable", she teaches Kira the ancient Japanese game of Goe, hoping this will help her in the fight against the Nogitsune. However, Kira's dad points out that Kira and her mother's match of Goe reads like two opponents going up against each other as opposed to a teacher and an apprentice. Kira realises she must go up against her mother and the Oni if she wants to save Stiles. However, both women are too late in stopping the Nogitsune, as he takes control of the Oni and kills Allison.</dd>

<li><b>Demon Warriors</b> (Season 3)</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>These demonic warrior entities are antagonists of season 3 and are first seen at the end of the episode "More Bad than Good" of season 3.5. At the Nemeton, an unseen figure is seen uprooting a plant emerging from the stump. A swarm of fireflies are then expelled from one of the five cracks in the tree stump and the numerous supernatural insects materialize into five demon warriors. The demon entities first appear at the Argents' apartment in "Galvanize" and attack Isaac Lahey leaving him in a state of <a href="/wiki/Hypothermia" title="Hypothermia">hypothermia</a>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>In the following episode "Illuminated", after Isaac describes his attackers, Chris Argent reveals he has a broken mask of the same variety the demons wear. The warriors show up at Derek's loft where Danny Mahealani is hosting a black light party. It is revealed they had tagged Isaac on the left side of his head with an unusual marking (<span class="t_nihongo_kanji"><span lang="ja" xml:lang="ja">己</span></span>) when he was attacked the night before. They attack and tag all the supernatural beings of the gang, the werewolves and Lydia, a banshee. Afterward, they fight and overpower former Alpha werewolf Derek and the True Alpha werewolf Scott McCall. The sun suddenly rises and they dematerialize. In "Silverfinger", Chris Argent relays a story when he was eighteen where three Oni appeared in the middle of Chris' first gun deal with Yakuza. The Yakuza entourage opened fire and they slaughtered all the men in their way and killed a Yakuza boss which was a supernatural being. Chris had shot off the mask of one of them saving the life of a Yakuza warrior named 'Silverfinger'. Chris, Allison and Isaac learn from 'Silverfinger' that the warrior entities are called the <a href="/wiki/Oni" title="Oni">Oni</a>, a race of demons whose purpose is to hunt down the the dark version of the <a href="/wiki/Kitsune" title="Kitsune">kitsune</a>, known as 'Void' or a Nogitsune. The mark they leave on people they have inspected is the Japanese kanji for "self", indicating that being is not possessed by a Nogitsune and is still themselves. The Oni inspect Scott and Kira, a kitsune and determine they are not possessed. At Beacon Hills Memorial hospital, the Oni come upon the Nogitsune, which is possessing Stiles Stilinski. When the Oni try to test Stiles, the Nogitsune seems to be able to withstand the Oni's power and destroys three of the five Oni, the fireflies used to form them disintegrating into smoke.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>In "Riddled", it is revealed that the kitsune Noshiko Yukimura was the one who brought the Oni to Beacon Hills to kill the Nogitsune. Noshiko appears to have the ability to summon and lead the Oni when she summons the two remaining Oni to her side when facing off against the Nogitsune. Noshiko has two more Oni created in "Letharia Vulpina" by sacrificing two mystical blades which she refers to as 'tails' in addition to five others previously used to form the previous five Oni. These two new Oni are more powerful than the others according to Noshiko. The Oni try to kill Stiles to destroy the Nogistune but Scott and kira (who has just discovered her strength as a kistune) fight them off long enough for Stiles to take shelter in the Mountain Ash-laced animal clinic. In "De-Void", Noshiko once again sends the Oni to destroy the Nogistune but he had arranged to be in the presence of people who didn't want Stiles to die. Derek, Allison, Chris, and Sheriff Stilinski fight off the Oni until Noshiko calls them off for an unexplained reason.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>In "Insatiable", after the Nogistune gets expelled from Stiles's body creating two Stiles, Noshiko leads the Oni to Eichen House to finally destroy him. She tries to stop Scott and his friends from saving him because they believe his life is still linked to Stiles's. As the Oni prepare to destroy the Nogistune, he uses the last of Noshiko's tails which he took from her to take control of the Oni. Having eliminated the greatest threat to his life, he turns the Oni on the assembled werewolves, kistunes, and hunters. Isaac is badly injured and almost killed in the fight but, as an Oni is about to deliver the final blow, Allison shoots an arrow into its chest, causing it to release a yellow light before violently dissolving into smoke. In retaliation, another of the Oni kills Allison by stabbing her through the abdomen before disappearing with the Nogistune.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The Oni are dressed like <a href="/wiki/Samurai" title="Samurai">Japanese samurai</a>, wearing black modified <a href="/wiki/Shinobi_sh%C5%8Dzoku" title="Shinobi shōzoku">Shinobi shōzoku</a> and black masks similar to the <a href="/wiki/Hannya" title="Hannya">hannya</a> which hides only dark energy instead of a face and they wield the Japanese sword, the <a href="/wiki/Ninjat%C5%8D" title="Ninjatō">Ninjatō</a>. Their eyes glow a greenish-yellow (similar a firefly) when they are investigating a person. The Oni possess the most versatile abilities seen in the series. They can materialize out of smoke and shadow, form their Ninjatōs in the same manner, have the capability to <a href="/wiki/Phase_(matter)" title="Phase (matter)">phase</a> through solid matter and they fight in a highly skilled martial arts combat style. When attacking Lydia, they supposedly muffle her banshee voice. The Oni can't operate during the day as the morning sun caused them to dematerialize. Oni have similar vulnerabilities to mountain ash as other supernatural creatures, although by working together and test for weaknesses, they can force their way through such a barrier.</dd>

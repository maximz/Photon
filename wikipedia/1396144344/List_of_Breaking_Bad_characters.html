<p><b>Walter Hartwell White</b> (also known by his clandestine alias <b>Heisenberg</b>) (played by <a href="/wiki/Bryan_Cranston" title="Bryan Cranston">Bryan Cranston</a>) is an underachieving <a href="/wiki/Albuquerque,_New_Mexico" title="Albuquerque, New Mexico">Albuquerque, New Mexico</a> high school chemistry teacher who, after being diagnosed with <a href="/wiki/Lung_cancer" title="Lung cancer">lung cancer</a>, starts manufacturing <a href="/wiki/Crystal_meth" title="Crystal meth" class="mw-redirect">crystal meth</a> to provide for his family upon his death. Knowing nothing about the drug trade, he enlists the aid of his former student, <a href="#Jesse_Pinkman">Jesse Pinkman</a>, to sell the meth he produces. Walt's scientific knowledge and dedication to quality lead him to produce crystal meth that is purer and more potent than any competitors'. To avoid the tedious collection of pseudoephedrine required for production, Walt devises an alternative chemical process utilizing <a href="/wiki/Methylamine" title="Methylamine">methylamine</a>, giving his product a distinctive blue color. His crystal meth, which is given the street name "Blue Sky", dominates the market, leading to confrontations with established drug kingpins.

<p>Walt is initially squeamish about the use of violence, but gradually comes to see it as a necessity. He also comes to find his new status as a <a href="/wiki/Drug_lord" title="Drug lord">drug lord</a> psychologically rewarding, leading him to become less and less reluctant to resort to criminal acts such as <a href="/wiki/Theft" title="Theft">theft</a>, <a href="/wiki/Extortion" title="Extortion">extortion</a>, <a href="/wiki/Money_laundering" title="Money laundering">money laundering</a>, <a href="/wiki/Depraved_indifference" title="Depraved indifference" class="mw-redirect">depraved indifference</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Murder" title="Murder">murder</a>.

<p><b>Skyler White (née Lambert)</b> (played by <a href="/wiki/Anna_Gunn" title="Anna Gunn">Anna Gunn</a>) is Walter's wife. She has had several meager sources of income: writing short stories, selling items on <a href="/wiki/EBay" title="EBay">eBay</a>, working as a bookkeeper, and ultimately helping her husband launder money. Skyler and Walter have a son, Walter Jr., and an infant daughter, Holly. Skyler cares for Walter very much, but their marriage becomes increasingly strained due to his unexplained absences and bizarre behavior, ultimately leading to their separation. Later, once Walter reveals his operation, she aids him in laundering his funds. They procure the car wash that Walter once had to work at. Although she helps Walter, she remains displeased with the situation overall. As Walter slowly becomes more of a "hardened criminal", her emotions of fear and worry for him become increasingly prevalent. When in "Buried", Hank tells Skyler he is on to Walt, but needs her help to provide sufficient evidence to build a successful case. Skyler replies that she needs a lawyer and later tells Walt they should remain quiet.</p>

<p><b>Jesse Pinkman</b> (played by <a href="/wiki/Aaron_Paul" title="Aaron Paul">Aaron Paul</a>) is a small-time methamphetamine user, manufacturer, and dealer. In high school, he was an inattentive student in Walter White's chemistry class. Now in his mid-20s, Jesse is Walt's business partner in the meth trade. Jesse is impulsive, hedonistic, and uneducated, but he is personable and possesses street-smarts as well. He talks in playful slang, likes to wear garish clothing that follows the latest trends in youth culture, plays video games, listens to rap and rock music, takes recreational drugs, and drives cars outfitted with gadgets to make them "bounce". When Jesse has money, he usually spends it throwing long-running parties for friends as well as strangers or on items like a <a href="/wiki/Large-screen_television" title="Large-screen television" class="mw-redirect">giant-screen television</a> for his home. Before his partnership with Walt, he added a little chili powder to make his methamphetamine stand out in the market. Walt insisted on making a pure product, and patronizingly taught Jesse the procedures to do it. Walt treats Jesse like a foolish son in constant need of stern correction. Jesse's own family kicked him out because of his drug use. Despite the friction between them, he and Walt have a deep bond of loyalty.</p>
<p>Like Walt (at least at the beginning), Jesse is horrified by the brutality at the higher levels of the drug trade, but does what he thinks is necessary. He is very protective of children: his desire to keep children out of the violent drug world gives rise to several key events throughout the series. He wrestles with feelings of guilt about the deaths, all drug-related, of people he's been associated with, especially his girlfriend <a href="#Jane_Margolis">Jane Margolis</a>. Jesse's last name, like Walter's, sounds similar to a character from <i><a href="/wiki/Reservoir_Dogs" title="Reservoir Dogs">Reservoir Dogs</a></i>.<sup id="cite_ref-Reservoir_1-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Reservoir-1"><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></a></sup></p>

<p><b>Henry R. "Hank" Schrader</b> (played by <a href="/wiki/Dean_Norris" title="Dean Norris">Dean Norris</a>) is Walt and Skyler's brother-in-law and Marie's husband, who works as a U.S. <a href="/wiki/Drug_Enforcement_Administration" title="Drug Enforcement Administration">Drug Enforcement Administration</a> agent. He is actively involved in investigating a meth kingpin known as "Heisenberg," unaware for over a year that his prey is actually Walter. Hank has a cavalier exterior, but in reality the dark side of his job affects him more than he cares to admit. In the course of his work, Hank is promoted to El Paso, Texas from Albuquerque for a short time but experiences a traumatic event and moves back to Albuquerque. Despite being loud and opinionated, Hank is highly competent at his job and cares deeply about his family. However, upon discovering that Walter is Heisenberg, Hank is overwhelmed with strong animosity towards Walter, to the point of saying he hopes Walt will "rot" when he learns that his cancer has returned. He immediately becomes obsessed with arresting his own brother-in-law, knowing that his D.E.A. career would be finished if it were revealed to the D.E.A. that Walt was Heisenberg. After he finds an infuriated Jesse about to burn down the Whites' house, he convinces him to help him catch Walt. Using their threat to destroy his drug money as bait, they induce Walter to disclose its location, and Hank succeeds in arresting him. Unfortunately for Hank, he and his partner Gomez are immediately caught in a shootout with Jack and his crew of heavily armed assassins who had earlier been hired by Walt to kill Jesse, and who, in spite of Walt's frantic attempts to call them off, have just arrived on the scene. In the shootout Gomez is killed and Hank is shot in the leg. After the shooting stops, Walt begs Jack to spare Hank in exchange for all of his buried $80 million drug money. Hank refuses to go along with the compromised terms, however, saying&#160;: "My name is <a href="/wiki/Special_agent#Other_titles" title="Special agent">A.S.A.C</a> Schrader, and you can go fuck yourself." After more attempted negotiating from Walt, Hank tells him: "You're the smartest guy I've ever met, and you're too stupid to see, he made up his mind ten minutes ago." He is then shot dead by Jack.</p>

<p><b>Walter White, Jr.</b> (played by <a href="/wiki/RJ_Mitte" title="RJ Mitte">RJ Mitte</a>) is Walter and Skyler's teenage son and Holly's older brother. He has <a href="/wiki/Cerebral_palsy" title="Cerebral palsy">cerebral palsy</a>, as manifested in speech difficulties and impaired motor control, for which he uses crutches (which Mitte, who has a milder variation of cerebral palsy, does not require<sup id="cite_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5"><span>[</span>5<span>]</span></a></sup>). Angered by his parents' constant fighting, Walter Jr. tries to establish an independent character, insisting on being called Flynn and asking his best friend Louis to teach him how to drive. However, upon discovering that Walt has cancer, Walter Jr. changes his attitude and sets up the website, <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.savewalterwhite.com">www.savewalterwhite.com</a>, which requests and collects donations in an effort to help pay for Walt's cancer treatment. Walt's lawyer, <a href="#Saul_Goodman">Saul Goodman</a>, arranges for a wave of fictional "donations" drawn from Walter's drug money, in order to launder it and also make Walter Jr.'s efforts appear successful. When Skyler and Walt separate, Walter Jr. ultimately takes his father's side and stops answering to the name Flynn. Always being "late to the game" (as defined by Mitte on an episode of <i><a href="/wiki/Talking_Bad" title="Talking Bad" class="mw-redirect">Talking Bad</a></i>), Walter Jr. remains oblivious to his father's drug trade life until "<a href="/wiki/Ozymandias_(Breaking_Bad)" title="Ozymandias (Breaking Bad)">Ozymandias</a>", when Marie, confident that Walt is in Hank's custody, forces Skyler to reveal the whole truth to her son.

<p><b>Marie Schrader (née Lambert)</b> (played by <a href="/wiki/Betsy_Brandt" title="Betsy Brandt">Betsy Brandt</a>) is Skyler's sister, Hank's wife, and Walt's sister-in-law. Marie works as a <a href="/wiki/Radiologic_technologist" title="Radiologic technologist">radiologic technologist</a>. She doesn't hesitate to offer advice to others, but often fails to practice what she preaches. She shoplifts obsessively—apparently a manifest symptom of <a href="/wiki/Kleptomania" title="Kleptomania">kleptomania</a>—for which she sees a therapist. She appears self-centered and shallow but is very devoted to her husband and cares deeply for her sister's family. Marie loves the color purple, and nearly all of her household and clothing items are various shades of that color.</p>
<p>In Season 3, Marie becomes a major source of comfort and support to her husband, when <a href="#Leonel_.26_Marco_Salamanca">The Cousins</a> shoot and nearly kill Hank. With Walt and Skyler's help, she arranges for Hank to undergo an aggressive physical therapy program that is not covered by their insurance. When Hank stubbornly decides to stay at the hospital, claiming he is completely disabled, she refuses to give up on him and gives him a hand job to prove he still has feeling below the waist. When he returns home, however, Hank is cold and brash to Marie, despite her attempts to make him comfortable, and she spirals back into kleptomania. Once Hank begins making progress with the case, his relationship with Marie improves again. When Walt and Skyler begin to have marital problems, she volunteers to take in their children for a couple of days while they work things out.</p>
<p>In the final season, Hank shares with Marie the truth about Walter's criminal activities, and Marie confronts Skyler. Learning Skyler has known of Walt before Hank was shot, Marie slaps her sister and storms out of the room angrily. She tries to take Holly with her, but Hank commands her to return the baby. She then urges Hank "to get" Walter. Marie helps Hank in attempting to stop Walt and Skyler but their attempts are thwarted when Walt makes a tape framing Hank. Marie is eager to help Hank when Jesse agrees to confess about Walt's crimes. She is initially unaware of Hank's death and reconciles with Skyler on the condition she tells Walt Jr. everything. Marie learns that Hank is missing when Walt kidnaps Holly, and eventually receives confirmation he is dead. She is last seen in her house two months later, warning Skyler to be on the look out for Walt.</p>

<p><b>Gustavo "Gus" Fring</b> (played by <a href="/wiki/Giancarlo_Esposito" title="Giancarlo Esposito">Giancarlo Esposito</a>) is the <a href="/wiki/Chile" title="Chile">Chilean</a>-born proprietor of Los Pollos Hermanos, a highly successful <a href="/wiki/Fried_chicken" title="Fried chicken">fried chicken</a> restaurant chain. He is also a public <a href="/wiki/Boosterism" title="Boosterism">booster</a> for the local <a href="/wiki/Drug_Enforcement_Administration" title="Drug Enforcement Administration">D.E.A.</a> office and a member of the hospital board. However, despite outward appearances, Gus is a major drug kingpin initially affiliated with the <a href="/wiki/Mexico" title="Mexico">Mexican</a> drug cartel in Ciudad Juárez, who uses his restaurant as a front for <a href="/wiki/Methamphetamine" title="Methamphetamine">methamphetamine</a> distribution throughout the <a href="/wiki/American_southwest" title="American southwest" class="mw-redirect">American southwest</a>. Like <a href="/wiki/Walter_White_(Breaking_Bad)" title="Walter White (Breaking Bad)">Walter White</a>, Gus is a criminal who "hides in plain sight", using his anti-drug philanthropy to conceal his true nature. Gus originally established Los Pollos Hermanos in Mexico several years previously, but emigrated to the <a href="/wiki/United_States" title="United States">United States</a> when <a href="/wiki/List_of_Breaking_Bad_characters#Don_Eladio" title="List of Breaking Bad characters">Don Eladio</a> and <a href="/wiki/Hector_Salamanca" title="Hector Salamanca" class="mw-redirect">Hector Salamanca</a> murdered his cook and close friend, <a href="/wiki/List_of_Breaking_Bad_characters#Maximino_Arciniega" title="List of Breaking Bad characters">Maximino Arciniega</a>, in retaliation for cutting into their business.</p>
<p>When Walt seeks a buyer for his chemically pure meth, he is put in contact with Gus. However, despite recognizing Walt's "excellent" product, Gus refuses to do business with him because of the erratic and careless behavior of his partner, <a href="/wiki/Jesse_Pinkman" title="Jesse Pinkman">Jesse Pinkman</a>. Walt manages to persuade Gus to purchase 38 pounds of his meth for $1.2 million; after the product yields good returns, Gus offers Walt $3 million for three months of his time. Gus' hiring and protection of Walt puts him at odds with the cartel's leadership, which considers Walt responsible for the death of Hector's nephew, <a href="/wiki/Tuco_Salamanca" title="Tuco Salamanca" class="mw-redirect">Tuco</a>. Gus directs <a href="/wiki/The_Cousins_(Breaking_Bad)" title="The Cousins (Breaking Bad)" class="mw-redirect">Leonel and Marco Salamanca</a>, two cartel assassins, to kill Walt's brother-in-law, <a href="/wiki/Hank_Schrader" title="Hank Schrader">Hank Schrader</a>. He also arranges for the hit to fail, ensuring that the U.S. and Mexican governments crack down on the cartel and leave control of the methamphetamine market to Gus alone.</p>
<p>Despite Gus' initial protection of Walt, the collaboration between the two men becomes increasingly strained. Walt learns that Gus is grooming his regular cook, <a href="/wiki/Gale_Boetticher" title="Gale Boetticher" class="mw-redirect">Gale Boetticher</a>, to replace him, leading Walt to task a reluctant Jesse with killing Gale.

Walt becomes increasingly fearful that Gus will kill him and his family, causing him to look for numerous ways to kill Gus first.

<p><b>Mike Ehrmantraut</b> (played by <a href="/wiki/Jonathan_Banks" title="Jonathan Banks">Jonathan Banks</a>) is a former <a href="/wiki/Philadelphia,_Pennsylvania" title="Philadelphia, Pennsylvania" class="mw-redirect">Philadelphia</a> police officer who works for <a href="/wiki/Gus_Fring" title="Gus Fring">Gus</a>—and, on occasion, <a href="/wiki/Saul_Goodman_(Breaking_Bad)" title="Saul Goodman (Breaking Bad)" class="mw-redirect">Saul</a>—as a private investigator, head of security, <a href="/wiki/Cleaner_(crime)" title="Cleaner (crime)">cleaner</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Hit_man" title="Hit man" class="mw-redirect">hit man</a>. His reasons for leaving the force in Philadelphia are never specified, but given his "half measures" story to Walt about missing a chance to kill an abusive perp who eventually murdered a victim Mike was trying to help, and Hank's refusal to bring up the reason of Mike's discharge from the police force during an interrogation, it is possible Mike decided to take revenge against the abusive perp which resulted in his departure from law enforcement. As such, one of the lessons Mike employed in his day to day business activities was to not take "half measures".</p>
<p>Mike is a calm and calculating individual who efficiently performed his duties for Gus, using his extensive knowledge to do so without detection. He is never shown to target or involve any innocent bystanders in his duties. Like Walt, Mike is a family man; he enjoys an affectionate relationship with his granddaughter Kaylee (played by Kaija Roze Bales).</p>
<p>Jesse first meets Mike in the Season 2 finale (<a href="/wiki/ABQ_(Breaking_Bad)" title="ABQ (Breaking Bad)" class="mw-redirect">"ABQ"</a>), when Mike cleans the scene and advises Jesse how to handle questions about Jane's death, in Jesse's bed. In Season 3 (<a href="/wiki/I.F.T._(Breaking_Bad)" title="I.F.T. (Breaking Bad)" class="mw-redirect">"I.F.T."</a>), Saul sends Mike to bug Walt's house and to tail him; in the process, Mike saves Walt's life when he sees The Cousins enter Walt's house with an ax, intent upon assassinating him, and Mike phones Gus, who calls off the hit. Mike also whisks Walt away from Ted's place of business, after Walt goes beserk, intent upon causing damage, after learning Skyler slept with Ted.</p>
<p>In Season 4, Jesse and Mike begin a rough and rocky relationship, and although initially frustrated at Gus's assigning him to Jesse, Mike learns to like Jesse after Jesse begins to show potential. However, Mike does not like Walt in the least; Mike tells Walt that Walt's dangerous to him, and Mike considers Walt to be selfish, arrogant, and egotistical. Mike later becomes a reluctant partner in Walt and Jesse's meth operation, while still despising Walt and feeling depressed over Jesse's choices.</p>
<p>Ultimately, Mike's involvement with Walt and Jesse leads to his downfall, when <a href="/wiki/Say_My_Name_(Breaking_Bad)" title="Say My Name (Breaking Bad)">Walt shoots Mike</a> for refusing to provide the names of the nine imprisoned men who work for him. Walt realizes moments after shooting Mike that he could have gotten the names from Lydia, and could have spared Mike's life.

With no one opposing them, Walt and Todd partner with another meth distributor, <a href="/wiki/List_of_Breaking_Bad_characters#Declan" title="List of Breaking Bad characters">Declan</a>, and Madrigal Electromotive executive <a href="/wiki/Lydia_Rodarte-Quayle" title="Lydia Rodarte-Quayle" class="mw-redirect">Lydia Rodarte-Quayle</a> to run a highly profitable meth empire for months across the <a href="/wiki/American_Southwest" title="American Southwest" class="mw-redirect">American Southwest</a> and overseas in the <a href="/wiki/Czech_Republic" title="Czech Republic">Czech Republic</a>. When Walter retires, the purity of the product falls, so Lydia reinstates Todd as the primary cook. The purity improves, but falls short of the standard expected by Lydia's foreign buyers. Todd also begins to harbor a crush on Lydia, a fact that Lydia exploits to keep him under control.</p>
<p>After the gang captures Jesse, Todd convinces his uncle to force Jesse to cook for them. Todd shoots and kills <a href="/wiki/List_of_Breaking_Bad_characters#Andrea_Cantillo" title="List of Breaking Bad characters">Andrea</a> to punish Jesse for an escape attempt. Months later, under the guise of offering a new method of cooking meth, Walter kills the gang through a remotely activated M60 machine gun installed in the trunk of a car. Todd survives the gunfire, but Jesse strangles him with the chains of his handcuffs to the point of snapping his neck.</p>
<p>Todd has been called the most dangerous villain on <i>Breaking Bad</i>.<sup id="cite_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-9"><span>[</span>9<span>]</span></a></sup> He is calm and exceedingly polite, and doesn't seem to take anything personally.

<p><b>Lydia Rodarte-Quayle</b> (played by <a href="/wiki/Laura_Fraser" title="Laura Fraser">Laura Fraser</a>) is an executive of Madrigal Electromotive <a href="/wiki/GmbH" title="GmbH" class="mw-redirect">GmbH</a>, working out of the company's office in <a href="/wiki/Houston,_Texas" title="Houston, Texas" class="mw-redirect">Houston, Texas</a>. Along with Jack and Todd, she serves as one of the antagonists of the final season. She appears to be nervous most of the time and acts aloof, regularly ordering <a href="/wiki/Chamomile_tea" title="Chamomile tea" class="mw-redirect">chamomile tea</a> with soy milk and the sweetener <a href="/wiki/Stevia" title="Stevia">stevia</a>. She helped <a href="/wiki/Gus_Fring" title="Gus Fring">Gus Fring</a> distribute drugs throughout the <a href="/wiki/American_southwest" title="American southwest" class="mw-redirect">American southwest</a>. When the <a href="/wiki/Drug_Enforcement_Administration" title="Drug Enforcement Administration">D.E.A.</a> begins investigating the link between Gus and Madrigal, Lydia becomes anxious and asks <a href="/wiki/Mike_Ehrmantraut" title="Mike Ehrmantraut" class="mw-redirect">Mike</a> to eliminate eleven people who were involved with Gus. When he refuses, Lydia makes the same offer to one of the eleven on her hit list and adds Mike to those she wants killed. However, Mike deduces her plan and dispatches the new hit man, but not before Chow is killed. Mike breaks into Lydia's home, ready to execute her, but allows her to live contingent on her providing him with <a href="/wiki/Methylamine" title="Methylamine">methylamine</a>.</p>
<p>After Lydia provides the first shipment, the D.E.A. visits Madrigal and Lydia is forced to give up her guy in the warehouse to the D.E.A. Mike sends Jesse to Houston to pick up the methylamine, and he and Lydia find a GPS tracker at the bottom of one of the barrels. Mike later deduces that Lydia placed it, because she wants out of the business. Mike again vows to kill her. Jesse, not wanting her to die, tries to intervene on the pretense that maybe the D.E.A. did plant the tracker. Walt sides with Jesse because he refuses to cease making meth. After bugging Hank's office, they force her to call him and ask about the device. Hank tells her his office did not plant any tracker, and the three are about to kill her until they hear the D.E.A.'s Houston office telling Hank that they placed trackers on every barrel, through the bug. In an effort to save herself, Lydia provides Walt, Jesse, and Mike information about a freight train that carries "an ocean of methylamine". Later, she provides Walt with a new market in the Czech Republic, using her resources and network to distribute the meth in large quantities.</p>
<p>After Walt quits, and Declan and his gang are massacred, Todd becomes Lydia's cook. During a meeting with Todd, Walt interrupts and offers to provide a new method of meth production. Lydia appears to agree to Walt's offer, but suggests to Todd after Walt leaves that Walt should be killed at the meeting. As their meeting continues, Lydia adds stevia to her tea, which Walt had replaced with ricin. That evening Lydia, showing the flu-like symptoms characteristic of ricin poisoning, calls Todd to check on whether the gang followed through on killing Walt. A gloating Walter answers and tells her that the entire gang is dead, and that she has been poisoned before he hangs up on a horrified Lydia.</p>

<p>Roberts first appears at the White household asking Skyler about Walt's disappearance after Tuco Salamanca kidnaps both Walter and Jesse and takes them to his uncle's house.

<p><b>Emilio Koyama</b> (played by John Koyama) is Jesse's former partner in the meth business and Krazy 8's cousin. According to Jesse, they met when they were still in elementary school. In the "Pilot" episode, Emilio is arrested during a D.E.A. raid on a house (at which Walter is present during a "ride along" with Hank) in which the D.E.A. is looking for meth supplier who goes by the street name "Captain Cook". Emilio makes bail and, suspicious that Jesse ratted him out to the police (although it is later revealed Krazy 8 was a D.E.A. informant), forces Jesse to lead him and Krazy 8 to Jesse's new partner. Emilio recognizes Walt from the time of his arrest and suggests killing both Walt and Jesse. Walt convinces them to spare their lives if he teaches them his meth formula. While the three are in the RV in the desert, Walt deliberately causes a chemical explosion and flees, trapping Emilio and Krazy 8 inside the RV with deadly phosphine gas. Emilio dies and Jesse subsequently disposes of his body by dissolving it in hydrofluoric acid in Jesse's bathtub.<sup id="cite_ref-Pilot_46-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Pilot-46"><span>[</span>46<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Cat.27s_in_the_Bag..._47-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Cat.27s_in_the_Bag...-47"><span>[</span>47<span>]</span></a></sup></p>

Although Walt did not intentionally bring about Jane's asphyxiation, he intentionally did not roll her on her side, so that she would choke to death.

They use a staged photo of a dead Jesse who's said to have been shot in the head to coax Huell into revealing that he and Kuby packed Walt's money into seven barrels, then loaded the barrels into a hired van. Huell also reveals that they washed the van afterwards because of all the dirt on it, implying that Walt's money was buried somewhere in the desert. Hank and Gomez tell Huell to sit and wait until they come back for him, but as they never return, his fate remains unknown.</p>

After the D.E.A. connects missing school equipment to methamphetamine production, Hugo is one of the initial suspects because of the access his custodial duties afford him.

<p><b>Ted Beneke</b> (played by <a href="/wiki/Christopher_Cousins" title="Christopher Cousins">Christopher Cousins</a>) is the president and owner of Beneke Fabricators. He gives Skyler her old job back as an accountant during the second season. Ted has always been attracted to Skyler but doesn't make any advances since her return. Ted commits <a href="/wiki/Tax_fraud" title="Tax fraud" class="mw-redirect">tax fraud</a> to keep the company alive and save everyone's jobs. He admits this when Skyler finds out while working on the company's books. Skyler sleeps with Ted in season three, to exact revenge against Walt, but she ignores Ted's offer for her to leave some of her things at his house. When Walt finds out about their affair, he goes to angrily confront Ted, who hides in his office. This escalates into a scene where Walt is escorted out by security and the company staff is aware of Skyler's relationship with Ted. Skyler later gets angry at Ted when he shows up at her house to ask about their relationship, and she later severs both her personal and professional ties with him.</p>
<p>In season 4, Ted meets with Skyler, who is now running a car wash, and notifies her of the <a href="/wiki/Internal_Revenue_Service" title="Internal Revenue Service">IRS</a>' criminal investigation into his company's tax fraud. Since Skyler is heavily linked to Ted's tax fraud, and her entire family would be put under surveillance if the investigation were to proceed, she intervenes by pretending to be a ditzy accountant at Ted's meeting with the IRS. While her show of incompetence (allegedly using <a href="/wiki/Quicken" title="Quicken">Quicken</a> to handle the company's accounting and ignoring electronic transactions) forestalls a full investigation, provided he pays his back taxes and penalties, she must still deal with his poor financial standing and ensure he complies with the IRS' stipulation. Skyler arranges for Ted to receive money to pay off his IRS obligations by having Saul manufacture a dead relative in Luxembourg who leaves Ted a sizable inheritance. However, a follow up by Saul reveals that Ted has leased a new Mercedes and is using the funds to reopen his business. When Skyler urges Ted to pay the IRS first, he refuses and tells her to leave. Seeing no alternative, Skyler is forced to reveal it is she who gave Ted the money. Ted still refuses to pay the IRS, as he will lose his home and social status, regardless. Skyler perceives his motive to be blackmail; she thinks he expects her to foot not only his tax bill but his other obligations as well. With no other options, Skyler has Saul Goodman send two of his men—<a href="/wiki/List_of_Breaking_Bad_characters#Huell" title="List of Breaking Bad characters">Huell</a> and <a href="/wiki/List_of_Breaking_Bad_characters#Kuby" title="List of Breaking Bad characters">Kuby</a>—to force Beneke to write the check. They succeed, but Beneke then panics and attempts to flee. In the process, he trips on a loose rug and crashes headfirst into a counter.</p>
<p>At the start of the fifth season, it is revealed that Beneke did not die from the fall. However, he has been gravely injured and possibly disabled by the accident. When Skyler visits an intimidated Ted at the hospital, he guarantees his silence.</p>

When Jesse's RV quits running, Clovis charges him an exorbitant amount to tow and store the vehicle, due to its cargo. Clovis repairs the RV and catches Jesse sleeping in it after Jesse has scaled the fence (and destroyed a portable toilet in the process) after being evicted from his home. Clovis orders Jesse to pay for the repairs and property damage and then threatens to sell off Jesse's inventory to cover the repairs, when Jesse claims he cannot furnish immediate payment. Jesse again breaks into the gated lot and drives through the gate without paying for the repairs. He later returns to pay Clovis for the repairs and damages and arranges to store the RV inside Clovis' gated lot for $500 per week. Clovis later sells Jesse a used red <a href="/wiki/Toyota_Tercel" title="Toyota Tercel">Toyota Tercel</a> hatchback.

His real name is not revealed. He takes a calm, non-judgmental approach to leading discussions and emphasizes that those attending his sessions are there not to improve themselves, but to learn self-acceptance. During an outdoor session at a campfire, he reveals to Jesse and other recovering addicts that in July 1992, while drunk on vodka and high on cocaine, he killed his six-year-old daughter by accidentally hitting her with his car. Jesse, still reeling from Jane's death, asks the Group Leader how can he not hate himself for what happened. The Group Leader responds that self-hatred and guilt stand in the way of achieving true change. The Group Leader is seen again in Season 4, when Jesse returns to a session distraught about killing Gale. During the session, Jesse nearly breaks down and yells at the Group Leader, claiming that his philosophy about "accepting yourself" for making mistakes is wrong and people should be judged for the things they have done. Jesse then asks the Group Leader if he just accepts himself for killing his daughter and admits to the whole group that the only reason he comes to these meetings in the first place is to sell meth to them. He asks the Group Leader if he's okay with that, to which the group leader responds, "No". Jesse retorts, "About time", and leaves the session.</p>

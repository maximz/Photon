</div>
</div>
Andrea (Laurie Holden) is Amy's older sister and a former <a href="/wiki/Civil_and_political_rights" title="Civil and political rights">civil rights</a> attorney. Andrea is cautious and extremely protective of her younger sister, with whom she has not always had the closest relationship. She undergoes a significant transformation following <a href="/wiki/Vatos" title="Vatos">Amy's death</a>. In the second season, she gradually becomes more independent and hones her shooting skills, having received <a href="/wiki/Secrets_(The_Walking_Dead)" title="Secrets (The Walking Dead)">tutelage by Shane</a>. After being <a href="/wiki/Beside_the_Dying_Fire" title="Beside the Dying Fire">separated from the group in the third season</a>, <a href="/wiki/Seed" title="Seed">she is rescued by Michonne</a> and is <a href="/wiki/Walk_with_Me_(The_Walking_Dead)" title="Walk with Me (The Walking Dead)">brought by Merle to Woodbury</a>, where she begins a romantic relationship with <a href="/wiki/The_Governor_(The_Walking_Dead)" title="The Governor (The Walking Dead)">The Governor</a>. She is eventually caught in the <a href="/wiki/I_Ain%27t_a_Judas" title="I Ain't a Judas">crossfire between The Governor and Rick</a> and attempts to mend relations, but later <a href="/wiki/Prey_(The_Walking_Dead)" title="Prey (The Walking Dead)">turns on The Governor</a> after learning his true intentions. She attempts to warn Rick of The Governor's plans but fails, as The Governor captures her and hides her, bound and gagged, in his torture chamber. The Governor <a href="/wiki/Welcome_to_the_Tombs" title="Welcome to the Tombs">then</a> orders <a href="/wiki/Milton_Mamet" title="Milton Mamet">Milton Mamet</a> to kill her, but Milton instead attacks The Governor, who knifes him in the abdomen, mortally wounding him. The Governor decides to lock them in the room together, planning for a reanimated Milton to eat Andrea. She struggles to retrieve a pair of pliers purposely dropped by Milton to cut herself free from her bonds; however, she is bitten by the zombified Milton before she kills him. Rick, Michonne, Daryl and Tyreese arrive at the torture chamber and discover the bitten Andrea. As per her request, Rick hands her his revolver and, with Michonne by her side, plans to shoot herself in the head to prevent her reanimation. Rick, Sasha, Tyreese, and Daryl give Michonne and Andrea privacy, and the audience hears a shot. Her body is later brought back to the prison for burial. Andrea is one of the names Carl suggests for Judith.</td>

Norman Reedus</div>
</div>
</div>
Daryl Dixon (Norman Reedus) is Merle's younger brother. A Southern <a href="/wiki/Redneck" title="Redneck">redneck</a> with a tough background, Daryl is a <a href="/wiki/Survivalist" title="Survivalist" class="mw-redirect">survivalist</a> and member of the Atlanta band. He is one of the top experts with hunting weapons, killing deer and other animals for food. Daryl's signature weapon is a <a href="/wiki/Crossbow" title="Crossbow">crossbow</a>, a valuable weapon in the new world due to its stealth properties, reusable ammunition, and low noise emission. He constantly struggles with his own insecurities. In the second season, he is the group member most committed to searching for Sophia Peletier, identifying with her cause. The <a href="/wiki/Pretty_Much_Dead_Already" title="Pretty Much Dead Already">discovery of an un-dead Sophia</a> causes him to become aloof towards the group, especially towards the girl's mother, <a href="/wiki/Carol_Peletier" title="Carol Peletier">Carol</a>. He eventually regains his bonds with the group and becomes a faithful follower of <a href="/wiki/Rick_Grimes" title="Rick Grimes">Rick Grimes</a> and Rick's right-hand man. He also forms a devoted friendship with Carol in seasons 2 and 3, having saved her multiple times and made a connection with her (in that both of them come from abusive backgrounds). Daryl is eventually reunited with Merle when they <a href="/wiki/Made_to_Suffer" title="Made to Suffer">become captives in Woodbury</a>, before Rick's group rescues them. The brothers eventually start residing at the prison, where Daryl helps Merle adjust. When <a href="/wiki/This_Sorrowful_Life" title="This Sorrowful Life">Merle leaves to kill The Governor</a>, Daryl pursues him. He finds that Merle has been killed and reanimated as a walker, forcing a tearful Daryl to put him down. When he returns to the prison, Daryl participates in the successful defense of the prison against the Woodbury army. He, Rick, and Michonne pursue The Governor's men; however, they discover the slaughtered army and a survivor named Karen. After arriving at Woodbury, they - with <a href="/wiki/Tyreese" title="Tyreese">Tyreese</a> and Sasha's help - discover a dying Andrea, who ends her own life. Daryl accompanies the group and the Woodbury citizens to the prison. In season 4, Daryl is among the prison's new "council" that leads the enlarged group of survivors, following Rick's renouncement of leadership. Daryl assists in the elimination of walkers in one of the prison's cell blocks. After learning that people are dying from an aggressive flu, he leads a successful supply run to retrieve medicine, however he loses trust in one of the survivors he rescued, Bob, who retrieved liquor instead of medicine. When the Governor attacks the prison again, he destroys the army's tank, but the prison is heavily damaged and survivors are scattered, forcing him to flee with Beth. He becomes pessimistic, and believes that he and Beth are the only survivors from the attack. He is recruited by Joe after Beth's kidnapping.</td>

Merle Dixon (Michael Rooker) is Daryl Dixon's older brother. A <a href="/wiki/Southern_United_States" title="Southern United States">Southern</a> <a href="/wiki/Racist" title="Racist" class="mw-redirect">racist</a> and misogynist, Merle lived with an abusive, neglectful father and acted out against society, which frequently landed him in juvenile institutions. Merle participates in one scavenging group mission with the Atlanta survivors and attacks members of the group, so Rick handcuffs him to a pipe. When walkers discover the group, T-Dog returns to free Merle but accidentally drops the key down a drainpipe and leaves him behind, after securing the entrance to the roof.<sup id="cite_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup> Rick, T-Dog, and others return later to rescue Merle, but it is revealed that Merle had already escaped – having cut off his own cuffed hand in order to escape from the walkers.<sup id="cite_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4"><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup> The group finds evidence that Merle survived his self-mutilation and escaped from the building he was trapped on; moreover, he may have stolen their truck to escape Atlanta.

He served as The Governor's second-in-command, but The Governor turns on him after Merle fails to kill Michonne, who <a href="/wiki/Made_to_Suffer" title="Made to Suffer">later returns</a>, kills The Governor's zombified daughter, Penny, and stabs The Governor in the eye. After Rick's group rescues him and Daryl, Merle is forced to join Rick's group at the prison, where he has difficulty adjusting. He attempts to prove himself by bringing Michonne to The Governor, but later changes his plan by letting Michonne go in order to take on The Governor himself. He kills eight of The Governor's henchmen (thereby improving the ability of Rick's small group to prevail in the upcoming war with The Governor's largely untrained army), but his ultimate plan fails, as The Governor kills him.

David Morrissey</div>
</div>
</div>
Phillip Blake, known as "The Governor" (David Morrissey) is the disturbed leader of the fortified town of Woodbury. The townspeople are unaware of his sinister motives and many dark secrets, such as keeping his zombified daughter, Penny, locked in a cage, collecting heads of walkers displayed in fish tanks for his own amusement, and ordering his men to ambush and kill National Guardsmen and steal their supplies. His trusted allies include Merle Dixon and Ceasar Martinez, as well as scientist Milton Mamet, whom he knew before becoming "The Governor". He forms a romantic relationship with Andrea, while Michonne becomes suspicious of him and leaves Woodbury. When Rick's group attacks Woodbury to rescue Glenn and Maggie, Michonne discovers The Governor's decapitated walker heads and kills Penny. This angers The Governor, who vows revenge against Rick's group, and he accuses Merle as traitor for lying to him about Michonne. Andrea suggests to him to form a truce with Rick, although he creates an army to ambush and eliminate Rick's group. Milton discloses the Governor's plans to Andrea, who <a href="/wiki/Prey_(The_Walking_Dead)" title="Prey (The Walking Dead)">escapes Woodbury</a> to warn Rick but is captured by the Governor in the process. When Merle ambushes his army, The Governor gains the upper hand and kills Merle, leaving him to reanimate. Back at Woodbury, The Governor pummels Milton for his betrayal and decides that Milton will be the one to kill Andrea. Milton attacks The Governor, who counters by fatally stabbing Milton in the gut; a reanimated Milton bites Andrea, who kills herself. The Governor and his army eventually attack the prison, but they are overwhelmed, leading them to retreat. The Governor, enraged at the newly conscripted Woodbury citizens for refusing to return and finish the fight against the prison group, proceeds to massacre the entire army, with the exception of Martinez and Shumpert,<sup id="cite_ref-amctv1_7-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-amctv1-7"><span>[</span>7<span>]</span></a></sup> who abandon him the next day. He returns to and destroys the deserted Woodbury. After months as an aimless wanderer, he meets the Chambler family - sisters Lilly and Tara, their terminally ill father David and Lilly's daughter Meghan, who reminds him of Penny - and adopts a false persona, "Brian Heriot". He commits good deeds for the family in order to erase his old persona. Following David's death, the Chamblers join him, and he and Lilly become lovers, but his efforts to start anew are put to the test when he encounters Martinez and his new group of survivors. He reverts to his old self when he believes that it is the only way to keep his new family safe, and he kills Martinez to become the new leader of the group. He captures Michonne and Hershel and rallies his army to help him take the prison, as he wants the place for his family. At the prison, he refuses Rick's offer to coexist, and he decapitates Hershel with Michonne's katana, prompting a firefight between his army and the prison inhabitants. When Lilly arrives at the prison with Meghan, who has died from a walker bite, he shoots Meghan in the head. Losing his purpose for taking the prison, he orders his army to destroy the prison's fences and kill the prison survivors. Rick ambushes and fights him while his army falls to Rick's group. When he almost kills Rick, Michonne stabs him through the chest and leaves him to die. Lilly approaches him and shoots him in the head.</td>

<td colspan="6">Beth Greene (Emily Kinney) is Hershel's younger daughter and Maggie's younger half-sister. She resides at a farm with her family and boyfriend, Jimmy. She sinks into a deep depression after watching her mother, half-brother and neighbors, who had become walkers and were being housed in her father's barn, get shot by Rick's group. She attempts to convince Maggie to commit suicide with her and shortly afterward, attempts it on her own by cutting her wrists in the bathroom, but eventually she changes her mind. She escapes when walkers attack the farm and kill Jimmy and her good fried Patricia. At the beginning of season 3, Beth becomes a more confident and useful member of the group, and is skilled at killing walkers. She sometimes sings to entertain or comfort the group. At the prison, she is often seen looking after baby Judith. When the Governor attacks the prison a second time, Beth hides with her father and Carl in the forest, and returns to the prison when the Woodbury army retreat. In season 4, Beth has developed a relationship with one of the new prison citizens, Zach. However, Zach is bitten and killed during a supply run, and Daryl delivers the news to Beth. She appears completely unfazed, replying "I don't cry anymore." and sets her Days Without an Accident board from 30 to 0. She is put in charge in isolating the group's children to protect them from the deadly virus, and reminds Maggie of her father's instruction: "We all have jobs to do." When the Governor arrives at the prison with Hershel and Michonne as hostages, she is horrified when she witnesses her father's death, and escapes the prison with Daryl. She maintains hope that they will find their companions, but when she discovers the body of two children, Luke and Molly, her hard exterior is broken and she cries. After finding a funeral home with Daryl, the two are separated by a group of walkers, soon after Beth is kidnapped, taken by someone in a black car with a white cross on the back window. Daryl attempts to catch the car but cannot. Her current status and whereabouts are unknown.</td>

Scott Wilson</div>
</div>
</div>
Veterinarian and farmer Hershel Greene (Scott Wilson) is a religious man and former alcoholic, clinging desperately to the old-world values in order to preserve his sanity. He resides at a farm owned by his family for years. His extensive medical and agricultural knowledge prove to be valuable assets to the group. He initially regards the walkers as dangerous but curable patients and therefore lets Otis keep walkers in the barn. Among the walkers are his wife and stepson. When Rick's group finds out about the walkers, they proceed to execute each one of them, which in turn traumatizes Hershel who tells the group to leave his premises. Rick manages to comfort Hershel and convince him to let them stay at the farm. When the farm is overrun with walkers, Hershel decides to stay in order to defend his farm, however Rick convinces him to leave the land. Hershel grows to trust Rick's leadership. In the season 3 <a href="/wiki/Seed_(The_Walking_Dead)" title="Seed (The Walking Dead)">premiere</a>, a walker bites him on the ankle; Rick amputates his leg at the knee, preventing the disease from spreading. Rick often confides in Hershel, seeing him as a reliable and sensible member of the group. When Rick becomes disillusioned following Lori's death and the Governor's impending attack, Hershel becomes frustrated with him, telling Rick to step up as a leader. Despite this, Hershel continues to be helpful to Rick, who <a href="/wiki/This_Sorrowful_Life" title="This Sorrowful Life">denounces sole leadership</a>. Hershel, along with Beth and Carl, hides outside the prison during Woodbury's retreat, and witnesses Carl kill a young Woodbury soldier that lowered his weapon. A worried Hershel tells Rick about Carl's actions. When the rest of Woodbury's citizens arrive at the prison, Hershel is welcoming and happy to have new blood. In the season 4 premiere, set nearly seven months later, Hershel has received care for his amputated leg and has been fitted with a prosthetic, allowing him to walk somewhat normally. He has become a leading member of the prison's "council" and has planted and grown a farm on the prison's lawn. Hershel continues to provide Rick and the rest of the prison with valuable advice and guidance. When a deadly influenza virus infects many inhabitants, Hershel volunteers to care for the sick in a quarantined cell block, where he survives an attack by those who reanimated after succumbing to the deceased. He and Michonne leave the prison to burn walkers, however the Governor ambushes them and keeps them captive. Hershel proposes that his group and the Governor's new army could coexist in the prison, but he is rebuffed by the Governor. When the Governor arrives at the prison and brings him and Michonne out, Rick offers similar suggestions as Hershel's. This leads him to smile before the Governor decapitates him with Michonne's katana. His head zombifies but it is put down by Michonne.</td>

Maggie Greene (Lauren Cohan) is Hershel's daughter and Beth's elder half-sister. A tomboy at heart, she scavenges supplies from the town. She has held a strong sense of faith throughout the years but begins to have doubt her beliefs. Her initial fling with <a href="/wiki/Glenn_Rhee" title="Glenn Rhee">Glenn Rhee</a> gradually develops into a genuine relationship. She, along with her family and Rick's group, is forced to leave her farm when it is <a href="/wiki/Beside_the_Dying_Fire" title="Beside the Dying Fire">overrun with walkers</a>. After many months living on the road, her group settles at the prison, where Maggie performs a crude C-section to deliver <a href="/wiki/Lori_Grimes" title="Lori Grimes">Lori Grimes</a>' baby. Maggie and Glenn are captured by Merle and later tortured by Merle and The Governor to disclose they are residing at the prison; Rick's group rescues them. During the escape from Woodbury Maggie kills two guards, one of whom is Haley, and also shoots Oscar in the head to prevent him from turning after he is <a href="/wiki/Made_to_Suffer" title="Made to Suffer">fatally shot</a>. She helps defend the prison during The Governor's first attack, and kills the sniper stationed in the guard tower. She accepts <a href="/wiki/This_Sorrowful_Life" title="This Sorrowful Life">Glenn's proposal of marriage</a> and participate in Rick's successful ambush on The Governor's second attack on the prison. She guards the prison until Rick's group returns with the Woodbury survivors. Months later, it is revealed that Maggie believed herself pregnant, and had asked Glenn to look for baby supplies on the next run. She later appears confident that she is not pregnant, but does not give a reason as to how she knows this. When Glenn is infected by deadly influenza virus that spreads to many survivors, Maggie pours out her sorrows to Beth. Hershel decides to risk exposure by caring for the sick, which fuels Maggie to take out her frustrations by killing walkers near the fences. She manages to rescue her father and fiancee by killing the reanimated infected that overran the quarantine zone, before Daryl's group returns with medicine. When the Governor arrives at the prison, Maggie and Beth are horrified when they witness their father's execution, and they participate at the counterattack against the Governor's militia. With the prison near destruction, Maggie is separated from Glenn and Beth, and flees the compound with Sasha and Bob. The three later discover the prison bus, with all the inhabitants inside dead and reanimated as walkers. After killing all the walkers, she is relieved when she realizes Glenn is not in the bus.</td>

</div>
</div>
Carl Grimes (Chandler Riggs) is Rick and Lori's son, and Judith's older brother. He worships his father and is frequently confronted with the realities of the harsh new world. When his friend Sophia Peletier becomes a walker and is put down by his father, he becomes bitter towards the group and acts stubbornly, wanting to use a gun and yearning to fight alongside everyone else. Carl taunts a trapped walker before attempting to shoot it, but inadvertently sets it free; the walker later kills Dale. Carl feels guilty and tells Shane and his father that he was responsible for Dale's death. He finds his father being followed by a zombified Shane, and shoots Shane. After leaving the farm and transferring to the prison, he gradually begins to mature in his actions and thoughts, demonstrates bravery and leadership, and becomes skilled in killing walkers. When his mother dies during childbirth, he is forced to shoot her to prevent her reanimation. He names his baby sister Judith, after his third-grade teacher. After Rick's continual bouts of insanity, Carl suggests to his father that Rick should relinquish his leadership, as Rick deserves a rest. <a href="/wiki/Hounded_(The_Walking_Dead)" title="Hounded (The Walking Dead)">Carl saves the injured Michonne's life</a>, when she appears outside the prison fence, but expresses resentment toward her on their <a href="/wiki/Clear_(The_Walking_Dead)" title="Clear (The Walking Dead)">road trip to King's County</a>.

Carl is displeased when his father returns with Woodbury's citizens to the prison. Rick, after giving up leadership, decides to live a life as the survivors' farmer to set an example to Carl. Due to this, Carl appears to have calmed down from his vigilante stint, and is attempting to live a normal life in the prison, gaining new friends among the new children. Carl witnesses Carol teach the children on how to use knives, and, despite Carol's urges not to tell his father, reveals this to Rick.

</div>
</div>

Andrew Lincoln</div>
</div>
</div>
Rick Grimes (Andrew Lincoln) is the series' central character. A former sheriff’s deputy in King's County, a small Georgia town, Rick is an <a href="/wiki/Everyman" title="Everyman">everyman</a><sup id="cite_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8"><span>[</span>8<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-9"><span>[</span>9<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-10"><span>[</span>10<span>]</span></a></sup> — smart, calm, just, a sharpshooter, and a good friend, husband and father — but flawed. He sees most problems as black or white and will often stubbornly cling to his personal strong moral code, which results in his not always making the best decisions. Rick is a natural leader, someone his fellow survivors will turn to in a crisis, confident in his guidance, even when he at times doubts himself. His overwhelming need to do the right thing and protect those who can't protect themselves may pull him away from his family, causing cracks of tension within his marriage and in his relationship with his son. His frustrations about leading his group and keeping them safe gradually change him into a darker character. When the group is forced to leave the overrun farm, Rick establishes a dictatorship, and announces those who don't want to follow his leadership can leave. Rick transfers the group to the prison. <a href="/wiki/Killer_Within" title="Killer Within">When Lori dies during childbirth</a>, he loses his sanity and repeatedly hallucinates her. He is forced to come into conflict with The Governor after his group attacks Woodbury to rescue Maggie and Glenn, and The Governor begins gunning for Michonne for killing The Governor's zombified daughter, Penny, and for putting out The Governor's eye. Rick eventually recovers from his bouts of insanity after encountering his long-lost friend, Morgan. When he is unable to make difficult decisions to keep his group safe, Rick relinquishes his role as a dictator and lets the group decide whether the prison is worth defending against The Governor. The group decides to stay, and they successfully defend the prison from The Governor, who flees with his army. Rick begins to worry about Carl's dark antics, such as killing the young Woodbury soldier, who Hershel said was trying to surrender, leading Rick and Carl to argue. Rick, Michonne, and Daryl head to Woodbury, intending to kill The Governor, and on the road discover The Governor's massacred army, rescue the lone survivor, Karen - who explains what occurred - and, in Woodbury, discover a dying Andrea. After Andrea kills herself to prevent reanimation, <a href="/wiki/Welcome_to_the_Tombs" title="Welcome to the Tombs">Rick brings Woodbury's survivors</a>, including Tyreese, Sasha, and Karen, to the prison, much to Carl's displeasure. Hoping to set an example to Carl, Rick has turned to gardening and taking care of pigs, and no longer runs the prison, leaving it up to the prison council. While checking animal traps, he meets a disheveled Irish woman called Clara in the forest, who asks him to let her and her husband join him and the other survivors at the prison. Rick agrees, as long as she answers three questions, but realizes that Clara's husband is a walker and she plans to kill him as his food. Clara stabs herself and Rick reveals his three questions to her before she dies: "How many walkers have you killed", "How many people have you killed", "Why?" Answering the last question, she says, "You don't get to come back from things." This resonates with Rick as chaos returns to the prison, with walker attacks at the inside and outside of the prison. He sacrifices his pigs to lure walkers away from the prison. Knowing his attempt to return to a normal life has failed, he burns his pig pen and gives Carl back his gun. When two inhabitants who have been infected by a deadly virus - Karen and another survivor, David - are found stabbed in the head and burned, Rick investigates the murders, and concludes that Carol was the killer; Rick sends Carol away from the prison. When the Governor arrives at the prison with Michonne and Hershel hostage, he proposes that the two groups coexist in the prison, pleading with the militia that they could come back from the things they have done. The Governor rejects his offer and decapitates Hershel, prompting an enraged Rick to initiate a battle between the two groups. Rick is shot in the upper thigh by Alisha. He brawls with the Governor, but he is almost strangled before he is saved by Michonne, who stabs the Governor. He reunites with Carl and leaves the prison devastated after finding Judith's empty, bloody baby carrier. He becomes more protective of Carl but falls asleep for an extended amount of time when they encounter a safe house. When he wakes up, he acknowledges his son's maturity and apologizes for his bad decisions. Michonne reunites with the two, however Rick has to deal with scavengers who raid his house while Carl and Michonne are in a supply run. After killing one raider, he escapes the house and rejoins with Michonne and Carl, and they head off towards the supposed sanctuary "Terminus".</td>

Jeffrey DeMunn</div>
</div>
</div>
Dale Horvath (Jeffrey DeMunn) is an older man and former car salesman. His age, calm affect, worldly experience, and RV provide the nucleus around which the small community of survivors has formed. He is wise, sometimes profound, and the respected elder of the group, though he is also rather feisty and not afraid to speak his mind or call others out for mistakes in judgment. Over time he, Andrea, and Amy bond, and he finds their friendship invaluable in getting beyond grieving for his late wife. Dale is fairly self-sufficient and ever watchful of the changing dynamics among the survivor community. His equipment and know-how make life without modern conveniences much more bearable for the group. Dale manages to talk Andrea out of a suicide attempt by putting himself at risk, as well. Dale becomes wary of Shane, after witnessing that Shane contemplated killing Rick beforehand as well as guessing that Shane killed Otis whilst retrieving medical supplies for Carl. Dale becomes upset at the group (with the exception of Andrea) when they decide to kill Randall to avoid any risks he might have posed. The group eventually postpones the execution, but Dale is killed by a walker who was stuck in mud and was accidentally lured by Carl earlier that day. Dale's death causes the group to reevaluate their unity and allow Randall to live.</td>

Danai Gurira</div>
</div>
</div>
Michonne (Danai Gurira) is a resourceful, self-sufficient, <a href="/wiki/Katana" title="Katana">katana</a>-wielding survivor. She first appears as a hooded figure accompanied by two walkers chained to her side-by-side, with their arms and lower jaws cut off (to prevent their attacking her or anyone else), who saves Andrea from the walkers in <a href="/wiki/Beside_the_Dying_Fire" title="Beside the Dying Fire">the season 2 finale</a>. When Michonne and Andrea are taken to Woodbury, Michonne immediately becomes suspicious of The Governor. She decides to depart Woodbury, which causes The Governor to <a href="/wiki/Hounded_(The_Walking_Dead)" title="Hounded (The Walking Dead)">send Merle and his men to kill her</a>. She foils the plan, and Merle abducts Glenn and Maggie instead. Michonne finds her way to the prison, where she assists Rick's group in rescuing the two. When she arrives at The Governor's residence, she discovers his walker heads, as well as the Governor's zombified daughter Penny, whom she kills in front of The Governor. The two fight, which leads her to stab him in the eye. When she returns to the prison, she begins to gain the trust of the people there after assisting them in numerous errands. The Governor tells Rick he should hand over Michonne to him in order to maintain peace between the two groups. A redeemed Merle decides to hand her over, but changes his plan and lets her go to fight The Governor's army alone, which <a href="/wiki/This_Sorrowful_Life" title="This Sorrowful Life">leads to his death</a>. After the prison group <a href="/wiki/Welcome_to_the_Tombs" title="Welcome to the Tombs">drives away The Governor's army</a>, which The Governor later massacres, Michonne and Rick arrive at Woodbury, where they discover Andrea dying from being bitten by a zombified Milton. Michonne is deeply saddened by the situation, and she stays by Andrea's side when Andrea commits suicide. Michonne later returns to the prison with Rick's group and the Woodbury citizens. She is also very unafraid of walkers to an extent where she sets free a small horde to slaughter. Months later, she has developed a desire to find The Governor, and has been searching for him on her horse whenever she can. She aims to search for him in <a href="/wiki/Macon,_Georgia" title="Macon, Georgia">Macon</a>. When she is injured fighting a walker, Beth treats her while taking care of Judith. When Beth has to remove Judith's puke on her shirt, Michonne holds the baby and begins to weep. During a supply run to get medicine, she is convince by Tyreese to stop her search for the Governor. She joins Hershel in burning walkers, however The Governor captures the two, but she escapes when the prison group engages The Governor's group in combat, and later saves Rick's life by running The Governor through with her katana. After putting down Hershel's zombified head, she becomes indifferent and wanders aimlessly until she encounters a walker that looks like her: a reminder that she could become one of the undead if she had lost all hope. She kills the walker alongside a large herd and manages to reunite with Rick and Carl. She and Carl go on a supply run, where she reveals to him that she had a three-year old son, Andre Anthony, who died shortly after the apocalypse. Her lover and Andre's father Mike and Mike's friend Terry eventually became her first walker pets. After reuniting with Rick, who escaped their safe house from raiders, the three proceed towards "Terminus", a possible sanctuary from walkers.</td>

</div>
Carol Peletier (Melissa McBride) is Sophia's protective mother and Ed's abused wife. She has a kind heart and puts herself out for others within the group. However, she can also become meek and overly emotional at times. She seems to gradually get more comfortable now that Ed is no longer there to make her feel out of place. She gets a little <a href="/wiki/TS-19" title="TS-19">claustrophobic when she and the group</a> travel into the <a href="/wiki/Centres_for_Disease_Control" title="Centres for Disease Control" class="mw-redirect">CDC</a>. In the second season, she is stricken with grief and depression over her daughter's going missing and eventually being discovered as a walker. She grows very close to Daryl, and gradually builds a sense of previously non-existent self-confidence. She initially doubts Rick's leadership, but later on starts to trust him in keeping the group safe. Throughout the third season she continues to grow into a dependable fighter and survivor and manages to <a href="/wiki/Hounded_(The_Walking_Dead)" title="Hounded (The Walking Dead)">keep herself alive</a> after being separated from the group, when the <a href="/wiki/Killer_Within" title="Killer Within">prison is overrun with walkers</a>. Carol's last discussion with Merle may have contributed to his decision-making in "<a href="/wiki/This_Sorrowful_Life" title="This Sorrowful Life">This Sorrowful Life</a>". Carol is one of the names Carl suggests for Judith, due to everyone thinking she is dead. Carol seems to share responsibilities with Beth for looking after Rick's baby daughter, Judith Grimes. In the 7 months leading up to Season 4, Carol has started a story time program for the younger kids from Woodbury, which is actually a cover for her self-defense and weapons training course for the children. She has kept the class a secret from Rick and the rest of the survivors. When the father of two children, Lizzie and Mika, dies to a walker attack, she becomes their adoptive mother. Despite Carol's urges, Carl, who has witnessed one of her sessions, tells Rick of her weapons training. Carol kills Karen and David in "<a href="/wiki/Infected_(The_Walking_Dead)" title="Infected (The Walking Dead)">Infected</a>, as she believed they were a threat to the group due to their having the flu which was spreading through the Prison. For both the safety of the group and Carol herself, Rick banishes Carol from the group. He gives her a car and supplies so she can make it on her own. She sees the prison's destruction from afar, and later encounters Tyreese, Lizzie, Mika and Rick's baby daughter Judith. She is surprised that Tyreese does not know yet of her involvement in Karen's death, and the group proceeds towards "Terminus", a possible sanctuary.</td>

</div>
Glenn Rhee (Steven Yeun) lived in Atlanta, where he delivered pizzas for a living. He is keenly aware of the extreme danger of his missions on behalf of the group, but because of his youth he is willing to take the risks. His knowledge of every shortcut in Atlanta proves extremely useful to the survivor group's survival, and he is an excellent scavenger. Glenn thinks well on his feet and shows great compassion and humanity. Despite all the horrors he's seen, he maintains an enthusiasm for life and its unexpected pleasures. He is an integral part of Rick's group, showing surprising depth and emotion when the group experiences devastating tragedy. In the second season, he develops a passionate relationship with Maggie, while living on the Greene farm. In the third season, he becomes more confident and displays courage and ingenuity. He and Maggie are captured by Merle and tortured by The Governor, leading them to disclose the prison's location. They are later rescued by Rick's group; however, Glenn becomes bitter when he suspects The Governor raped Maggie, and he fills in as the leader when Rick and Daryl are absent. He later renews his relationship with Maggie and proposes marriage to her in the <a href="/wiki/This_Sorrowful_Life" title="This Sorrowful Life">penultimate episode</a>. He is among the people who retaliate against The Governor's army, and stays at the prison until Rick and Michonne return with the remaining Woodbury residents. Glenn and Maggie get married in between seasons 3 and 4. Later, Maggie thinks she is pregnant, and so he participates in the ill-fated supply run to a grocery store so that he can retrieve baby supplies. Later, it is revealed that Maggie is not pregnant as she thought before. Glenn, however, becomes infected with a deadly virus that has ravaged the prison population, and he put on quarantine. When some of the infected succumb to the disease and reanimate, a young child named Lizzie saves him from a walker. He is saved by Hershel, who gives him a breathing apparatus to survive, and is later treated with medicine by Bob. When the Governor attacks the prison again, he is still weak but manages to be escorted by Maggie out of the prison. However, he leaves the bus, and is left behind in the prison. He rests alone in his cell, but becomes motivated to find his wife, and he gathers the prison's remaining supplies. Wearing riot armor for protection, he fights a large amount of walkers in the courtyard, rescues Tara Chambler, one of the members of the Governor's army, and escapes the prison. The two encounter Abraham Ford, Eugene Porter and Rosita Espinosa, and comes into conflict with Abraham when their missions collide. When Eugene accidentally disables the truck, Abraham's group is forced to set aside their mission, bringing Eugene to Washington, D.C. to find a cure for the apocalypse, to assist Glenn and Tara in finding Maggie.</td>

</div>
Tyreese (Chad Coleman) is the leader of a group that includes his sister Sasha and Allen's family. His group initially seeks refuge at the prison, but after Rick drives them out, they find their way to Woodbury and reside there. He, along with Sasha, become guards at Woodbury's walls, but he gradually becomes wary of The Governor's intentions. Even though they know they will probably be expelled from the community for it, Tyreese and Sasha decide to remain in Woodbury to guard its citizens instead of joining The Governor's attack on the prison. When Rick's group arrives at Woodbury, Tyreese decides to let them in after Karen tells them about The Governor's massacre of his army. Tyreese and Sasha accompany Daryl, Rick, and Michonne in finding Andrea, whom they learn the reanimated Milton has bitten. After Andrea kills herself to prevent her reanimation, Rick's group takes Tyreese, along with Sasha, Karen, and other citizens of Woodbury to the prison. He becomes a prominent member of the survivor group. He has also started a relationship with Karen. He remains sensitive to the events surrounding him; he feels uncomfortable killing walkers at the prison fences, and then reaffirms that he dislikes leaving the prison since one of their own, Zach, was killed by walkers. Tyreese is saddened when Karen is struck by a fatal illness. He later visits her with flowers, but is horrified when he sees Karen's burned body outside her cell. He commands Rick to investigate on the murder, and attacks Daryl and Rick out of frustration. After burying Karen and visiting Sasha, who was also infected with the illness, he joins Daryl's group to retrieve medicine from a college, and miraculously survives a massive herd of walkers converging on him. They manage to retrieve the medicine and return just in time to save the remaining infected. Tyreese is among Rick's group who fight the Governor's militia. He is saved by two young girls, Lizzie and Mika, and escapes the prison with the children. He also rescues Rick's baby daughter Judith, but has to deal with her constant crying. When he hears screams, he leaves Judith with the girls and proceeds to assist a family in fighting walkers. However, he fails to rescue them from being bitten and killed. He is surprised when he discovers that Carol has rescued the girls, and he hugs Carol, oblivious to the fact that Carol is Karen's killer. The group then head towards a possible sanctuary named "Terminus".</td>

Jon Bernthal</div>
</div>
</div>
Shane Walsh (Jon Bernthal) was a sheriff’s deputy in a small Georgia town; he was Rick’s partner in the sheriff’s department and best friend since high school. Shane harbors feelings for Lori, and the two begin a sexual relationship after Shane tells Lori that Rick is dead. Among the group of survivors, Shane initially acts as the de facto leader, a position he enjoys. He has always lived in Rick's shadow and, while he never consciously resented it, he relishes his newfound position of authority. Shane is the primary antagonist in Season 2, becoming increasingly prone to bouts of irrational violence and bloodlust, which gradually develop from the first season. His strong survival instinct and breakdown of conscience results in the deaths of Otis and Randall and in life-threatening gestures toward Dale and Rick, until Rick ultimately kills Shane in an act of self-defense. After Shane dies, he reanimates as a walker, tries to bite Rick, and is finally brought down by Carl. In "<a href="/wiki/Made_to_Suffer" title="Made to Suffer">Made to Suffer</a>", Rick mistakenly believes he sees Shane during the attack on Woodbury, walking through the smoke where "Shane" fatally shoots Oscar before Rick shoots and kills him. When Rick inspects the body, it turns out to be that of an ordinary Woodbury soldier and not Shane.</td>

<p>Woodbury is a town in Georgia, of which a few streets have been walled off to keep the town operating. It is led by Philip Blake, who has adopted the nickname "The Governor" from the townspeople. Woodbury had a population of close to eighty people at the time of Andrea and Michonne's arrival, but due to various factors (such as the prison group's attack on the town and The Governor's slaughter of nearly his entire army), the population dwindles dramatically throughout Season 3. Robert Kirkman later confirmed that any and all Woodbury characters who were not brought to the prison are deceased. The remaining population of Woodbury at the Prison Community dwindles further throughout Season 4 as a result of the spreading of the flu. As of the Season 4 episode "<a href="/wiki/Inmates_(The_Walking_Dead)" title="Inmates (The Walking Dead)">Inmates</a>," nearly every resident of Woodbury is confirmed to be deceased, as the bus is apparently overwhelmed and everyone on board becomes zombified (and later put down by Maggie Greene, Bob Stookey, and Sasha). It has been confirmed that any other Woodbury resident (With the exception of Jeanette) not seen dying either on the bus or at the prison is deceased nonetheless. Thus, as of the episode "<a href="/wiki/Inmates_(The_Walking_Dead)" title="Inmates (The Walking Dead)">Inmates</a>," the entire population of Woodbury is confirmed to be dead.</p>

<p>After The Governor executes most of the able-bodied Woodbury residents who had been members of his army, only the children and elderly townspeople remain at Woodbury (under the watchful eye of Tyreese and Sasha). After Andrea's suicide after being bitten, Rick and his group return to the prison with the remaining Woodbury survivors (including Tyreese, Sasha, Karen, Eryn, Jeanette, and Ms. McLeod), swelling the prison's population from the original ten to around 30.<sup class="Template-Fact" style="white-space:nowrap;">[<i><a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources.

Some of those people are Ryan Samuels, Mika Samuels, Patrick, Zach, Lizzie Samuels, Luke, Owen, Molly, Julio, and Charlie. The compound is initially peaceful and thriving, until a flu epidemic spreads throughout the community and infects numerous residents, killing many of those stricken. However, when the scouting group returns with medicine, the issue is resolved. Shortly afterward, The Governor returns with a militia and executes the captive Hershel, igniting a firefight between the two groups. This battle leads to the fall of the prison community after The Governor tears down the fences. Most of the survivors escape on a prison transport bus, but a few are sent scattered in different directions.</p>

He and Meghan frequently play board games with each other so that Meghan can be preoccupied and distracted from the frightening world around her. David has stage-4 lung cancer and is rapidly approaching his moment of death. Knowing this, Lilly sends The Governor ("Brian") to a nearby assisted living facility to obtain oxygen tanks to help keep David alive for as long as possible, even if for just a few more hours. Early the next day, David succumbs to his cancer and dies. After he has lain lifeless in bed for several hours, his family and ("Brian") enter his bedroom to say goodbye to him. David then suddenly reanimates and grabs Tara. He almost bites her, but "Brian" smashes David's head several times with one of his oxygen tanks, until he finally succumbs. The family is disoriented by this incident, but each of them later recovers. Later, "Brian" and Lilly bury David in a small field behind the apartment complex, and the four of them depart in search of other shelter.</td>

She slowly comes to trust him, especially after he risks going to a walker-overrun assisted living facility to retrieve oxygen tanks for David, who is suffering from stage-4 lung cancer and will soon die (which she knows will be especially devastating to Meghan). When "Brian" kills the reanimated David, Lilly appears to be upset for a brief while, but soon comes to terms with what happened. After David's burial, the four of them depart in search of other shelter. They spend the night sleeping in a catering truck, and Lilly and "Brian" lay awake talking to each other. Slowly, they then begin to have sex. When the truck fails to start, the group abandons it and wanders on the road, until a swarm of walkers forces them to flee. They arrive at an open field, only to be stopped once again, when "Brian" and Meghan fall into a pitfall trap containing several walkers, all of which "Brian" kills before they can do any harm. Lilly and her family join Martinez's group. She is initially against The Governor's attacking the prison, but he assures her that she and Meghan will be safe. She and her daughter are left near a river; however, Meghan is bitten by a walker and dies. Lilly brings Meghan's corpse to the prison, where she witnesses The Governor decapitate Hershel and shoot Meghan in the head.

Lennie James</div>
</div>
</div>
Morgan Jones (<a href="/wiki/Lennie_James" title="Lennie James">Lennie James</a>) is a survivor staying in Rick Grimes’ hometown with his son, Duane. Following the walker outbreak, Morgan evacuated with his son Duane and his wife Jenny. Their plan was to head for Atlanta in search of military protection. En route, a walker attacked Jenny, forcing the family to seek refuge in a vacant house belonging to Rick’s neighbor. After Jenny died of the walker virus and reanimated, Morgan and Duane stayed in the town, fearful of moving on, with Morgan also unwilling to leave Jenny behind even though she is now a walker. Fiercely protective, Morgan barricades himself and Duane inside the house. Despite the dire conditions, Morgan still endeavors to create normalcy for Duane, correcting his son’s grammar and engaging in mealtime prayers. Both remain haunted by the loss of Jenny, who returns to the house regularly as a walker and turns the doorknob. Morgan and Duane meet Rick after he returns from the hospital; they take him in and tell him about the rise of the dead, its effects, and the possibility of survivors in Atlanta. Morgan declines Rick’s invitation for him and Duane to accompany Rick to Atlanta, so Rick eventually parts ways with the father and son. Morgan plans to end his wife’s suffering as a walker and help his son learn how to effectively use firearms; the two promise to reunite after Duane learns to shoot. In season 3, Rick finds Morgan in a dysfunctional state, paranoid, threatening to kill all who intrude in his town, and living in a house full of booby traps and writings on the walls. We learn that Morgan's son Duane was killed by his undead mother. Morgan states that he has to "clear" and decides not to return with the group to the prison. Lennie James stated in an interview following the airing of "<a href="/wiki/Clear_(The_Walking_Dead)" title="Clear (The Walking Dead)">Clear</a>" that Morgan is still alive. He was initially reported to return as Morgan in Season 4,<sup id="cite_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-14"><span>[</span>14<span>]</span></a></sup> his cast role not specified. However showrunner Scott M. Gimple confirmed that he will not appear in the fourth season, saying that he was misquoted.

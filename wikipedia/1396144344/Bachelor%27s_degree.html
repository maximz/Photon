<p>A <b>bachelor's degree</b>, <a href="/wiki/Latin_language" title="Latin language" class="mw-redirect">Latin</a> <i>baccalaureus</i> or <i>baccalarium</i> (from the Latin bacca, a berry, and laureus, "of the <a href="/wiki/Bay_laurel" title="Bay laurel" class="mw-redirect">bay laurel</a>"), is usually an <a href="/wiki/Academic_degree" title="Academic degree">academic degree</a> earned for an undergraduate course of study or major that in theory, depending on the location and the topic of study, is supposed to last three to five years, but can range more widely in duration, depending on ability and diligence of the student, whether or not the student balances work and other life commitments while attending school, the student's existing level of education, the availability of classes, and school policies. In some cases, it may also be the name of a second graduate degree, such as a <a href="/wiki/Bachelor_of_Laws" title="Bachelor of Laws">Bachelor of Laws</a> (L.L.B.), [(Bachelor of Education)] (B.Ed.),<a href="/wiki/Bachelor_of_Civil_Law" title="Bachelor of Civil Law">Bachelor of Civil Law</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Bachelor_of_Music" title="Bachelor of Music">Bachelor of Music</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Bachelor_of_Philosophy" title="Bachelor of Philosophy">Bachelor of Philosophy</a>, or the <a href="/wiki/Bachelor_of_Sacred_Theology" title="Bachelor of Sacred Theology">Bachelor of Sacred Theology</a>, degree which are normally offered after a first graduate/bachelor's degree. Also it is part of the "postgraduate" one-year <a href="/wiki/Honours_degree" title="Honours degree">Bachelor <i>(with) Honours</i></a> or <i>Baccalaureatus Cum Honore</i> degree (translatable as "gold-plated <a href="/wiki/Scepter" title="Scepter" class="mw-redirect">scepter</a>" by using the Latin baculum and aureatus), which is following a Bachelor´s degree; program involves completion of master's level courses and the submission of a high research thesis, and degree allows entry to a doctorate (Ph.D) or very high research master's program.</p>
<p>During the Renaissance, those who received a doctorate, upon passing their final examinations, were decorated with berried branches of bay, an ancient symbol of highest honor. From this ancient custom derives the Latin word <i><a href="/wiki/Baccalaureus" title="Baccalaureus" class="mw-redirect">baccalaureus</a></i> (from the Latin <i>bacca</i>, a berry, and <i>laureus</i>, "of the <a href="/wiki/Bay_laurel" title="Bay laurel" class="mw-redirect">bay laurel</a>") and by modification, the term "bachelor" in referring to one who holds a university degree.<sup id="cite_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1"><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></a></sup> <i>Baccalaureus</i> should not be confused with <i>baccalaureatus</i> (from the Latin <i>baculum</i>, gold plated, and <i>aureatus</i>, <a href="/wiki/Scepter" title="Scepter" class="mw-redirect">scepter</a>) which is use for an one- to two-year postgraduate "Bachelor <a href="/wiki/Honours_degree" title="Honours degree">with Honours</a>" degree in some countries.</p>

In some countries, e.g. Australia and Canada, the Honours degree schould not be confused with the "postgraduate" Bachelor's degree <i>With Honours</i> or Baccalaureatus Cum Honore degree. It is a consecutive academic degree, which is the continuation of a completed (Honours) Bachelor degree program in the same field and is usually obtained in order to join a <a href="/wiki/PhD" title="PhD" class="mw-redirect">PhD</a> programme; it requires a minimum of one years but may also take longer.</p>

Degrees are classified as First Class, Second Class Division One (2:1), Second Class Division Two (2:2) and Third as in English degrees, but without being described as honours. The main degrees are named by British tradition (Arts, Science, Law, etc.), but in recent years there have been a numbers of degrees named after specific subjects, such as Bachelor of Library and Information.</p>

<p>In Morocco Bachelor's degree is referred to as <i>al-ʾijāzah</i> (Arabic, French: <i>license</i>). It lasts three years that are further divided into two cycles. The first cycle comprises the first, or propedeutic, year. Students, after successfully completing their first year, can pursue either theoretical specialization (<i>études fondamentales</i>) or professional specialization (<i>études professionnelles</i>). The second cycle is two years long, after completing which, students are conferred upon the <i>Licence d’Etudes Fondamentales</i> or the <i>Licence Professionnelle</i>.<sup id="cite_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup> This academic degree system was introduced in September 2003<sup id="cite_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4"><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup></p>

<p>University admission is extremely competitive, with attendant advantages and disadvantages. Nonetheless, it takes four to five years to complete a bachelor's degree. In cases of poor performance, the time limit is double the standard amount of time. For example, one may not study for more than 10 years for a five-year course. Students are normally asked to leave if they must take longer. Nigerian universities offer BSc, BTech (usually from Universities of Technology), BArch (six years), and other specialized undergraduate degrees, such as BEng (Bachelor of Engineering degree). Science undergraduate degrees may require six months or a semester dedicated to SIWES (Students Industrial Work Experience Scheme) but it is usually mandatory for all engineering degrees. A semester for project work/thesis is required, not excluding course work, during the bachelor thesis in the final year. The classifications of degrees: first-class, second-class (upper and lower), third-class (with honours; i.e., BSc (Hons)) and a pass (no honours). First- and second-class graduates are immediately eligible for advanced postgraduate degrees (i.e., MScs and PhDs), but other classes may be required for an additional postgraduate diploma before such eligibility.<sup id="cite_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5"><span>[</span>5<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>Furthermore, all graduating students are obliged to do the <a href="/wiki/National_Youth_Service_Corps" title="National Youth Service Corps">National Youth Service Corps</a> (NYSC) requirement, which usually takes one year, after which they are eligible to pursue higher degrees. The NYSC is a paramilitary service that involves students' being posted to different parts of the country to serve in various capacities. Principal objectives of the NYSC are to forge national cohesion, encourage students to apply their obtained knowledge to solving problems of rural Nigeria, and others. The NYSC was established by law after the Nigerian Civil War.<sup id="cite_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6"><span>[</span>6<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>Polytechnical schools (polytechnics) in Nigeria are not considered universities. They are mandated to educate technicians of high calibre; they offer the OND (ordinary national diploma) and the HND (higher national diploma). The polytechnics focus very strongly on practical technical training. The BSc and HND are compared in engineering circles but there are significant differences in training philosophies.</p>
<p>Honours degrees in Nigeria are differentiated only on the basis of performance. Honours degrees include the first-class degree, second-class degrees (upper and lower) and the third-class degree, but not the pass. All university students must do an independent research project which applies the knowledge obtained during the previous years of study.</p>
<p>The project work must be submitted in the semester before graduation and usually takes a significant number of points. Further course work is not precluded during the project work, but the courses are fewer and are at an advanced level. Project work is orally defended before the faculty and before peers. In the sciences and engineering a demonstration of the project is usually required. The exceptions are theoretical work, for which a media project is required.</p>

Engineering universities provide four-year degree programs for bachelor's degree courses of study. Medical colleges have five-year degree programmes. In law education there is a two-year LLB degree after completing three years in a BA program for a total of five years of study. There is also a four-year LLB honours degree. All of these programs begin after achieving the Higher Secondary Certificate (HSC — in total 12 years of education).</p>

<p>In Pakistan, commerce and science colleges provide four-year bachelor's degrees (BA, BS, BBA, BCom, etc.). Generally these programs are of four years duration as elsewhere in the world and begin after completing higher secondary school education by receiving a HSSC certificate acknowledging one's 12 years of study by the respective board. After successful completion of these programs, a bachelor's degree is awarded by the respective university. Some colleges are affiliated with a university (mostly the state's central university) and teach a part-time degree equal to fourteen years of education such as a two-year BA, BCom etc. A student may enroll in a two years BA, BCOM as well as a 4 year BA as an external candidate (external candidate are enrolled for examination &amp; study program on self basis or through private tuition providers). Main universities offering these two programs are University of Punjab and University of Karachi where more than 50,000 students appear in BA &amp; BCom exam as external candidates.</p>
<p>Engineering and medical colleges provide four- and five-year degree programs respectively for bachelor's degrees (<a href="/wiki/Bachelor_of_Engineering" title="Bachelor of Engineering">BE</a>, BS (Engg), BSc (Engg), BArch, and B.Tech begin after a three-year Diploma of Associate Engineer, MBBS) that also begin after secondary school year 12. The Bachelor of Architecture (BArch) degree program is of five to six years' duration. When a four-year Bachelor of Technology (B-Tech) degree is earned after a three-year Diploma of Associate Engineer, it is called B-Tech (Hons), and when a four-year B Tech Degree is obtained after FSc (Two-year intermediate in Science), then it is called a four-year B-Tech. But generlay B-Tech Degree is obtained after 3-year Diploma of Associate Engineer and therefore it is called B-Tech Honors, because it is 17 year of schooling as compared to other degrees like BSc Engineering, or BE, BBA, etc. which are 16 year of schooling.</p>

<p>In Australia a Bachelor’s degree is three to five year program. Entry to a number of professions such as law practice and teaching require a Bachelor’s degree (a ‘professional’ degree). Other degrees, such as Bachelor of Arts don’t necessarily elicit entry into a profession, though many organisations require a Bachelor’s degree for employment.</p>
<p>An one-year "postgraduate" <a href="/wiki/Honours_degree" title="Honours degree">(With) Honours degree</a> can be achieved as a consecutive stand-alone Bachelor (with) Honours degree following a Bachlor's degree in the same field. In some cases, it may be offered as an "on course" degree program, which takes one year of research at the completion of an undergraduate four-year (Bachelor’s) degree.<sup id="cite_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8"><span>[</span>8<span>]</span></a></sup> It is usually available only to students who achieve a distinction average in their undergraduate studies. Degree involves completion of master's level courses and the submission of a long high research thesis. In this way the Australian Honours degree differs from the English/Welsh Honours, which requires only the completion of a short so called "dissertation" as part of the three-year Bachelor’s degree.<sup id="cite_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-9"><span>[</span>9<span>]</span></a></sup> Some Bachelor’s degrees (e.g. engineering and environmental science) include an integrated honours degree as part of a four-year program. Honours is generally for students who want to take up a research track for <a href="/wiki/Postgraduate_studies" title="Postgraduate studies" class="mw-redirect">postgraduate studies</a>, and increasingly for those who want an extra edge in the job market. Marking scales for Honours differ; generally, First Class Honours (80–100%) denotes an excellent standard of achievement; Second Class Division 1 (75–79%) a high standard; Second Class Division 2 (70–74%) a good standard; Third Class (65–69%) satisfactory standard; between 50-64% the degree is not awarded with honours, but may be conferred as a pass degree; a final mark below 50% is a fail of the course.</p>
<p>The Honours program allows students to pursue an independent research project in an area of interest under the supervision of an academic staff member. Students acquire skills which will enable them to work without close supervision in a research environment in industry or government, or to proceed to a higher degree by research (such as a PhD).<sup id="cite_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-10"><span>[</span>10<span>]</span></a></sup> First-class and second-class (first division) is generally the standard required for entry into a PhD or very high research Master's program in Australia. In science, a second-class research honours or higher is generally prerequiste for entrance to a PhD program (a Master's is an uncommon route).</p>

<p>In New Zealand, only recognised institutions—usually universities—have degree-awarding powers.</p>
<p>Most bachelor's degrees are three years full-time, but certain degrees, such as the Bachelor of Laws and the Bachelor of Engineering degrees, require four years of study. A Bachelor of Medicine degree requires a minimum of six years.</p>
<p>Where students opt to study two bachelor's degrees simultaneously — referred to as a "conjoint degree" or "<a href="/wiki/Double_degree" title="Double degree">double degree</a>" - an extra year of study is added. The number of years of study required is determined based on the degree with the greatest number of years. For example, a Bcom degree requires three years of full-time study, but a double Bcom-LLB degree will require five years of full-time study because the LLB degree is four years long. Exceptional students may choose to complete a degree in a shorter amount of time by taking on extra courses, usually with the help of summer school. Students who complete a double degree program will have two separate bachelor's degrees at the end of their studies.</p>
<p>Consistently high-performing students may also be invited to complete the 'honours' programme. This usually requires an extra year of study with an extra honours dissertation. An honors award is credited with "Hons." (e.g., Bachelor of Laws (Hons.)). Some degrees also offer a Post Graduate Diploma, which often consists of the same workload, but with added flexibility. PGDip does not usually require a dissertation, however the student may complete one if desired. A diploma award is credited with 'PGDip' and the name of the degree (for example, 'PGDipArts' or 'PGDipScience'.</p>

<p>In Brazil a bachelor's degree takes from three years to six years to complete depending on the course load and the program. A bachelor's degree is the title sought by Brazilians in order to be a professional in a certain area of human knowledge. Master's and doctoral degrees are additional degrees for those seeking an academic career or a specific understanding of a field.</p>
<p>Even without a formal adhesion to the <a href="/wiki/Bologna" title="Bologna">Bologna</a> system, a Brazilian "bachelor's" would correspond to a European "first cycle". A Brazilian "bachelor's" takes three to six years<sup id="cite_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-11"><span>[</span>11<span>]</span></a></sup> for completion, as well as usually a written monograph or concluding project, in the same way that a European bachelor's can be finished in three to four years, after which time Europeans may embark on a one- to two-year 2nd cycle program usually called a "Master's", according to the <a href="/wiki/Bologna_Process" title="Bologna Process">Bologna Process</a>.</p>
<p>Depending on programs and personal choices, Europeans can achieve a Master's degree in as little as four years (a three-year bachelor's and a one-year Master's) and as long as six years (a four-year bachelor's, a two-year Master's) of higher education. While in Brazil it would be possible to have a specialization "lato-sensu" degree - which differs from a Brazilian "stricto-sensu" master degree - in as little as three years (two years for a "tecnólogo"<sup id="cite_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-12"><span>[</span>12<span>]</span></a></sup> degree and an additional year for a specialization) or as long as eight years (six years for professional degrees, plus two years for a master's "stricto-sensu" degree - typical in medicine or engineering). Postgraduate degrees in Brazil are different from Europe, and highly incompatible with ECTS credits system.</p>

<p>In Colombia secondary school has two milestones, in 9th and 11th grades. After completing the first 4 years of secondary school (6th, 7th, 8th and 9th grades) a student is considered to have completed the basic secondary school while after completed the last two years (10th and 11th grades) is considered to have completed "bachillerato" or high school diploma.</p>
<p>This degree can be only academic (the most common) or:</p>
<ul>
<li>military, given by military specialised schools and gives the opportunity for male students not to go to obligatory military service.</li>
<li>commercial, which grants students focussed skills on accountancy.</li>
<li>technical, which grants students focussed skills on technical abilities such in electricity, mechanics and related matters.</li>
<li>normal, which grants students focussed skills on elementary education.</li>
</ul>
<p>After graduating from high-school, hopeful students must present a nation-wide exam that determines their eligibility to apply for their desired program, depending on the score the student achieves on the exam. In Colombia the system of academic degrees is similar to the U.S. model. After completing their "bachillerato" (high school), students can take one of three options. The first one is called a "Profesional" (professional career), which is similar to a bachelor's degree requiring from four to six years of study according to the chosen program, However strictly-career-related subjects are taken from the very beginning unlike U.S.A. where focused career-related subjects usually are part of the curriculum from the third year. The other option is called a "Técnico" (technician); this degree consists of only two and a half years of study and prepares the student for technical or mechanical labors. Finally, the third option is called a ¨Tecnólogo¨ (equivalent to Associate degree), and consist of 3 years of study. A technical school gives to the student, after a program of two years, an <a href="/wiki/Classification_of_Academic_Degrees" title="Classification of Academic Degrees">under graduate degree</a> in areas like software development, networks and IT, accountancy, nursing and other areas of health services, mechanics, electricity and technic-like areas.</p>
<p>Universities offer graduate degrees in ICFES endorsed programs like medicine, engineering, laws, accountancy, business management and other professional areas. A typical undergraduate program usually takes 10 or 11 semesters and some (i.e. medicine) require an additional period of service or practice to apply for the degree. A student who has obtained an undergraduate degree can opt to continue studying a career after completing their undergraduate degree by continuing onto Master's and Doctorate degrees. They can also choose to a specialization in certain fields of study by doing an extra year.</p>

<p>In the Czech tertiary education system, most universities and colleges today offer a three-year bachelor program, which can be followed up typically with a two-year Master's (graduate) program. Some specializations, such as doctors of medicine and veterinary doctors, hold exceptions from the general system in that the only option is a six-year Master's program with no bachelor stage (graduate with title doctor).

<p>The bachelor's degree was re-introduced at universities in Denmark in 1993, after the original degree (baccalaureus) was abandoned in 1775. The bachelor's degree is awarded after three or four years of study at a university and follows a scheme quite similar to the British one. Two bachelor's degrees are given at the university level today:</p>
<ul>
<li><i>Bachelor of Science</i> (<i>BSc</i>), awarded to students with main focus on scientific, medical, or technical areas.</li>
<li><i>Bachelor of Arts</i> (<i>BA</i>), awarded to students whose main focus is on humanistic, theological, or jurisprudence areas.</li>
</ul>
<p>However, both in the business and the academic world in Denmark, the bachelor's degree is still considered to be "the first half" of a Master's (<a href="/wiki/Master%27s_degree" title="Master's degree">candidatus</a>). It is not considered a degree in its own right .<sup class="Template-Fact" style="white-space:nowrap;">[<i><a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources.

<p>The bachelor's degree has also been used since the late 1990s in a number of areas like nursing and teaching. Usually referred to as a "profession-bachelor's", these degrees usually require four years of study at a college. These bachelor's degrees do not grant automatic access to a university Master's program, as opposed to the traditional bachelor's degrees awarded by universities. These degrees are considered to be a full education, and it often brings more confusion than clarification when someone explains that they have a bachelor's degree in some field.</p>

<p>Bachelor's degrees, called "<i>Bakkalaureus</i>", originally existed in Germany but were abolished up until 1820 as part of educational reforms at this time. The <a href="/wiki/Abitur" title="Abitur">Abitur</a> degree—the final degree received in school after a specialized 'college phase' of two years—replaced it, and universities only awarded graduate degrees.</p>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/Magister_(degree)" title="Magister (degree)">Magister</a> degree, a graduate degree, was awarded after five years of study.

Since the introduction of the <a href="/wiki/Fachhochschule" title="Fachhochschule">universities of applied sciences</a>, a shortened version of the latter, referred to as <i>Diplom (FH)</i> and designed to take three to four years, was introduced between 1969 to 1972.</p>
<p>However, to comply with the Bologna process, in 1998 a new educational law reintroduced the bachelor's degree (first degree after three years of study) in Germany. Today these degrees can be called either "<i>Bakkalaureus</i>" or "Bachelor" (in accordance with federal law), but the English term is more common.

<p>The traditional degrees have been re-mapped to the new <a href="/wiki/European_Credit_Transfer_and_Accumulation_System" title="European Credit Transfer and Accumulation System">European Credit Transfer and Accumulation System</a> (ECTS) point system to make them comparable to the new bachelor's degree.

<dd>Traditional, 300 ECTS</dd>

<p>In the Netherlands, the Bachelor of Arts and Master of Arts degrees were introduced in 2002.

Those who had already started the doctorandus program could, upon completing it, opt for the doctorandus degree (before their name, abbreviated to 'drs.'), or simply use the master's degree (behind their name) in accordance with the new standard.

</ul>
<p>While the titles ing., bc., ir., mr., drs. and dr. are used before one's own name, the degrees B, M or D are mentioned after one's name. It is still allowed to use the traditional titles.</p>
<p>Whether a bachelor's degree is granted by a <i>hogeschool</i> or university is highly relevant since these parallel systems of higher education have traditionally served very different purposes, with the vocational colleges concentrating on skills and practical training. A B.A or B.Sc from a university grants 'immediate' entry into a master's program. Moreover this is usually considered a formality to allow students to switch to foreign universities master's programs. Meanwhile those having completed a HBO from a vocational college, which represented the highest possible level of vocational education available, can only continue to a "master's" on completion of a challenging year of additional study, which in itself can serve as a type of selection process, with the prospective M.Sc. students being required to cover a great deal of ground in a single year.</p>
<p>Recently, HBO (vocational) master's degrees have been introduced in the Netherlands. Graduates thereof may use neither the extension "of Arts" (MA) nor "of Science" (MSc). They may use an M followed by the field of specialization (e.g., M Design).</p>
<p>This year of study to "convert" from the vocational to academic (WO-<i>wetenschappelijk onderwijs</i>, literally "scientific education") is also known as a "bridge" or "premasters" year. Note that despite the use of the terminology "university of applied science" the higher vocational colleges are not considered to be "universities" within the Netherlands.</p>
<p>Important aspects of Dutch bachelor's degree courses (and others) relative to some of those offered abroad include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Duration. While in many countries courses are completed in a given time under normal circumstances, degree courses offered at some (though by no means all) Dutch institutions, including the most prestigious, can only be completed in three years by the best performing students.</li>
<li>Academic year. The Dutch academic year has a formal duration of 42 weeks. In practice students are often expected and required to spend a great deal of the "free" time revising for examinations. This is not always true elsewhere, as in many countries a very long summer break is taken and/or examinations are before the winter break rather than after.</li>
<li>Learning curve. Some education systems, notably the British one, involve a gentle introduction during the first year. This is generally not the case in the Netherlands, with the difficulty level in the first year serving as a type of "self-selection" with less committed and less able students routinely finding it difficult to keep up.</li>
</ul>
<p>In February, 2011, the Dutch State Secretary of Education decided to adhere to the recommendations written in a report by the Veerman Commission. In the near future, the distinction between academic and higher vocational degrees will disappear.</p>

A <i>licenciatura</i> (equivalent to a bachelor) degree diploma from <a href="/wiki/Portugal" title="Portugal">Portugal</a></div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Presently, the Portuguese equivalent of a bachelor's degree is the <i>licenciatura</i>, awarded after three years of study (four in some few cases) at an accredited <a href="/wiki/List_of_higher_education_institutions_in_Portugal" title="List of higher education institutions in Portugal">university or polytechnical institution</a>. It is an undergraduate first study cycle program which is required to advance into further studies such as master's degree programs.</p>
<p>Before the Bologna process (2006/2007), the <i>bacharelato</i> (bachelor's degree) existed in the Portuguese higher education system. It required three years of study, being roughly equivalent to the present <i>licenciatura</i>. At that time, the <i>licenciatura</i> referred to a <a href="/wiki/Licentiate" title="Licentiate">licentiate</a>'s degree (equivalent to the present master's degree), which required usually five years of study. A <i>licenciatura</i> could also be obtained by performing two years of study after obtaining a <i>bacharelato</i>.</p>
<p>Today, the former and current <i>licenciatura</i> degrees are referred in Portugal, respectively, as pre-Bologna and post-Bologna <i>licenciaturas</i>. Some Portuguese professional regulatory bodies, only allow access, to the respective professions, of holders of a pre-Bologna <i>licenciatura</i> (or holders of a present master's degree), not considering enough to hold a post-Bologna <i>licenciatura</i>.</p>

<p>In Spain the traditional system (up to 2009/2010) was split into three categories of degrees. There were the so-called first-cycle degrees: "Diplomado" or "Ingeniero Técnico", with nominal durations varying between three and four years; there were also second-cycle degrees: "Licenciado" or "Ingeniero" with nominal durations varying between four and six years; and finally the third-cycle degrees: "Doctor". The official first-cycle degrees are comparable in terms of duration, scope, and educational outcomes to an Anglo-Saxon bachelor's degree. Meanwhile the second-cycle degrees are comparable in terms of duration, scope, and educational outcomes to an Anglo-Saxon bachelor's + Master's degrees combination if compared with the Anglo-Saxon system. In this traditional system the access to doctoral studies was granted only to the holders of "Licenciado" or "Ingeniero" (second-cycle) degrees.</p>
<p>Due to the ongoing transition to a model compliant with the <a href="/wiki/Bologna_agreement" title="Bologna agreement" class="mw-redirect">Bologna agreement</a>, exact equivalents to the typical Anglo-Saxon bachelor's degree and Master's degree are being implemented progressively in Spain. Now there is an undergraduate bachelor's degree called "Título de Grado" (its duration generally being four years), a postgraduate Master's degree called "Título de Máster" (one or two years), and a doctor's degree called "Título de Doctor". The "Título de Grado" is now the prerequisite to access to a master study. The "Título de Máster" is now the prerequisite to access to doctoral studies.</p>

<p>The Swedish equivalent of a bachelor's degree is called <i>kandidatexamen</i>. It is earned after three years of studies, of which at least a year and a half in the major subject. A thesis of at least 15 ECTS credits must be included in the degree. Previously, there was a Bachelor of Law degree (<i>juris kandidat</i>) which required 4.5 years of study, but this degree now has a new name, <i>juristexamen</i> ("law degree").</p>

<p>Like Austria and Germany, Switzerland did not have a tradition of bachelor's and Master's degrees. In 2003, after the application of the Bologna process, bachelor's and graduate Master's degrees replaced the old degrees. As of 1 December 2005 the Rectors' Conference of the Swiss Universities granted holders of a lizentiat or diploma the right to use the corresponding <i>master</i> title. As of 2006, certificates of equivalence are issued by the university that issued the original degree. Currently three to four years of study are required to be awarded a bachelor's degree. A master's degree will require another two to three years of coursework and a thesis.</p>

<p>The Universities of Oxford and Cambridge are perhaps alone in the United Kingdom today in awarding the BA for all undergraduate degrees. However, on a global scale, many universities over the last hundred years have expanded the range of bachelor's degrees enormously, especially in countries such as Australia, New Zealand, Pakistan, India, and South Africa. This represents a move towards specialization in <a href="/wiki/Tertiary_education" title="Tertiary education">tertiary education</a>, in which college or university in these countries is intended to be a training for a specific career, and therefore akin to <a href="/wiki/Vocational_education" title="Vocational education">vocational education</a>. It is a departure from the <a href="/wiki/Liberal_arts" title="Liberal arts" class="mw-redirect">liberal arts</a> approach common in the United States, in which the graduate is versed in a wide variety of subjects in addition to an <a href="/wiki/Academic_major" title="Academic major" class="mw-redirect">academic major</a> with the intent they be well prepared to pursue any number of careers or a progression of careers.</p>
<p>In England most first degrees not leading to professions (such as law, engineering, medicine) are now assumed to be honours degrees, although ordinary degrees are still awarded to those who do not meet the required pass mark for a third-class honours degree. The requirement for entrance into a Chartered Engineer path is an undergraduate Master's degree (MEng) or a bachelor's honours degree (BEng) plus either additional exams equivalent to a Master's degree or a Master of Science (MSc) degree.</p>

<p>Degrees awarded carry designations related to the broad subject areas such as BA, BSc, and BEng. The majority of bachelor's degrees are now honors degrees. Until the mid-20th century, some candidates (but not, for example, those at Oxford or Cambridge) would take an ordinary degree and then be selected to go on for a final year for the honours degree. A first degree course is usually three years but it might be reduced to two either by direct second-year entry (for people who have done <a href="/wiki/Foundation_degree" title="Foundation degree">foundation degrees</a> or changed subject areas or done something similar) or by doing compressed courses (which are being piloted by several newer universities).<sup id="cite_ref-17" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-17"><span>[</span>17<span>]</span></a></sup> For funding reasons (funding for undergraduate programs is automatic, while funding for postgraduate programs is not) it is becoming increasingly common to skip the bachelor's stage entirely and to go straight to the <a href="/wiki/Master%27s_degree" title="Master's degree">Master's</a> level on a four-year (five-year if with industrial experience) course (which often shares the first two years with the equivalent bachelor's course).</p>
<p><i>Honours degrees</i> are of a superior academic standard. An honours degree is always awarded in one of four classes depending upon the marks gained in the final assessments and examinations. The top students are awarded a first-class degree, the next best, an upper second-class degree (usually referred to as a 2:1), the next a lower second-class degree (usually referred to as a 2:2), and those with the lowest marks gain a third-class degree. An <i>ordinary</i> or <i>unclassified</i> degree (which does not give the graduate the right to add <i>(Hons)</i>) may be awarded if a student has completed the full honours degree course but has not obtained the total required passes sufficient to merit a third-class honours degree. Alternatively a student may be denied honours if he/she has had to retake courses.</p>

<p><i>Ordinary degrees</i> are unclassified degrees awarded to all students who have completed the course and obtained sufficient marks to pass the final assessments and examinations. Although ordinary degree courses are often considered to be easier than honours degree courses, this is not always the case, and much depends on the university attended and the subject being studied. Some modern universities offer the opportunity for ordinary degree students to transfer to an honours degree course in the same subject if an acceptable standard is reached after the first or second year of study.</p>

<p>At Scottish universities, undergraduate degrees are differentiated as either <i>Designated Degrees</i> or <i>Honours Degrees</i>.</p>
<p>An Honours degree, BA (Hons), (awarded as an <a href="/wiki/Master_of_Arts_(Scotland)" title="Master of Arts (Scotland)">MA (Hons)</a> by some universities) for arts and social sciences, or B.Sc. (Hons) for sciences, is awarded for students who have completed four years at university — two years at <i>sub-honours</i> level, studying a variety of different subjects, and two years at <i>honours</i> level studying one subject in depth. Depending on the University and course, the third and fourth years can be divided into junior honours and senior honours while in other cases the final year is simply called the honours year.</p>
<p>Each year, students will be given a number of subjects to study, with each subject given a number of <i>credits</i> which can be awarded upon passing that subject. A certain number of credits are required to gain entry into the next year and the amount of credits awarded each year is directly related to the subjects passed that year. As such, it is generally required to pass all subjects in a year to gain entry into the next.</p>
<p>It is typical that the grade of the degree will be assessed from the combined grades of both years at honours level, meaning the grades achieved in each subject in these years will account to the final class of degree awarded. Generally the percentage contributed toward the degree class in the final honours year will be much higher than that of the first honours year. Also, sometime in the honour years, a course usually includes a large project or number of projects to be undertaken, such as a <a href="/wiki/Dissertation" title="Dissertation" class="mw-redirect">Dissertation</a> - although not always the case. A dissertation contributes a large percentage to that years grade as the workload is often viewed as a number of subjects combined and is therefore graded in the same manner.</p>
<p>Honours degrees are subdivided into <a href="/wiki/British_undergraduate_degree_classification#Degree_classification" title="British undergraduate degree classification">classes</a> depending on the overall grade achieved. These are from highest to lowest; first class, upper second class (2:1), lower second class (2:2), and third class.</p>
<p>A <i>designated degree</i> (BA, MA or BSc) is awarded to students who have completed three years at university studying a variety of related subjects. The first two years, sometimes three, of both a <i>designated degree</i> and an honours degree are identical, but candidates for the designated degree study in less depth in their final year and often over a wider variety of subjects. Candidates for the designated degree do not usually complete a dissertation. A Scottish "designated degree" is different from an English "pass degree", even though both are denoted "BSc" (Bachelor of Science) and are often referred to as ordinary degrees. In keeping with the Scottish "broad education" philosophy, ordinary degrees (and more rarely honours ones) may mix different disciplines such as sciences and humanities taught in different faculties and in some cases even different universities.</p>

<p>Different universities and/or degrees however may have different processes. For example, the <a href="/wiki/University_of_St_Andrews" title="University of St Andrews">University of St Andrews</a>' <a href="/wiki/Bute_Medical_School" title="Bute Medical School" class="mw-redirect">Bute Medical School</a> traditionally awards medical students a BSc (Hons) after a three-year degree course—one year studying "Foundations of Medicine" involving basic medicine training, followed by a two-year honours course and dissertation.<sup id="cite_ref-18" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-18"><span>[</span>18<span>]</span></a></sup> This is not consistent with the usual four years required to attain such a degree.</p>
<p>Medical students at many other UK institutions have the further privilege of obtaining intercalated degrees (see <a href="/wiki/Medical_school_in_the_United_Kingdom" title="Medical school in the United Kingdom">medical school in the United Kingdom</a>); a process which allows participants to obtain an intercalated BSc in a given field after only one year of study. Such programmes are available at most universities and are in place to offer students studying medicine a wider perspective on fields that are often only briefly covered in a medicine course.</p>
<p>Students are not automatically eligible to participate. This process in many ways reflects the US system of first obtaining a degree before studying postgraduate medicine.</p>

<p>Education in Canada is governed independently by each province and territory, and thus there are differences between provinces when it comes to the granting of degrees. Each province loosely follows the United States model but e.g. in Québec also the French model. Bachelor's degrees may take either three or four years to complete and are awarded by colleges and universities. In many universities and colleges bachlor´s degrees are differentiated either as bachlors´s or as honours bachelor´s degree. The term "Honours" is an academic distinction, which indicates that students must achieve their bachelor's degree with a sufficiently high overall grade point average; in addition, some programs may require more education than non-honours programs. The honours degrees are sometimes designated with the abbreviation in brackets of '(Hon(s))'. It should not be confused with the consecutive bachelor's degree "with Honours", Latin "<b>Baccalaureatus Cum Honore</b>", abbr. e.g. <b>BA hon.</b> <i>de jure</i> without brackets and with dot. It is a "postgraduate" degree which is considered to be the equivalent of corresponding maîtrise degrees under the French influenced system.</p>
<p>Going back in history, a three-year bachelor´s degree (also known e.g. in Québec as grade de bachelier) was also called a <i>pass degree</i> or <i>general degree</i>. A student who first achieve a general bachelor's degree with a sufficiently high overall average may be admitted to a "postgraduate" Baccalaureatus Cum Honrore degree in the same field; it requires a minimum of one years but may also take longer; it typically does not exceed two years. Students are required to undertake a long high quality research empirical thesis (Honours Seminar Thesis) combined with a selection of courses from the relevant field of studies. The consecutive degree is essential if students ultimate goal is to study towards a two- or three-year very high research masters´ degree qualification. A student holding a Baccalaureatus Cum Honore degree also may choose to complete a Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) program without the requirement to first complete a Master's degree. Over the years, in some universities certain Baccalaureatus Cum Honore programs have been changed to corresponding master´s degrees.</p>
<p>Generally, an (honours) bachelor's degree is a prerequisite for admission into graduate studies in Canada.</p>
<p>In the province of Quebec, students have to go through a minimum of two years of <a href="/wiki/College_education_in_Quebec" title="College education in Quebec">college</a> before entering, for example, a three-year Bachelor of Science (B.Sc.) or a four-year Bachelor of Engineering (B.Eng.) program. As a consequence, there is no <i>de jure</i> "honors degree" (although some universities market some of their programs as being <i>de facto</i> honors degrees in their English-language materials), but there are some specializations called "concentrations" in French, which are mostly taken as optional courses.</p>

Those students are awarded the same bachelor's degree as students completing the standard curriculum but with the notation <i><a href="/wiki/In_cursu_honorum" title="In cursu honorum">in cursu honorum</a></i> on the <a href="/wiki/College_transcript" title="College transcript" class="mw-redirect">transcript</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Diploma" title="Diploma">diploma</a>. Usually, the above Latin honors are separate from the notation for this honors course, but a student in the honors course generally must maintain grades worthy of at least the <i>cum laude</i> notation anyway.<sup id="cite_ref-20" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-20"><span>[</span>20<span>]</span></a></sup> Hence, a graduate might receive a diploma <i>Artium Baccalaureatum rite</i> or <i>Artium Baccalaureatum summa cum laude</i> in the regular course or <i>Artium Baccalaureatum summa cum laude in cursu honorum</i> in the honors course.</p>
<p>If the student has completed the requirements for an honors degree only in a particular discipline (e.g., English language and literature), the degree is designated accordingly (e.g., BA with Honors in English). In this case, the degree candidate will complete the normal curriculum for all subjects except the selected discipline ("English," in the preceding example). The requirements in either case usually require completion of particular honors seminars, independent research at a level higher than usually required (often with greater personal supervision by faculty than usual), and a written honors thesis in the major subject.</p>
<p>Many universities and colleges in the United States award bachelor's degrees with <a href="/wiki/Latin_honors" title="Latin honors">Latin honors</a>, usually (in ascending order) <i><a href="/wiki/Cum_laude" title="Cum laude" class="mw-redirect">cum laude</a></i> ("with honor/praise"), <i><a href="/wiki/Magna_cum_laude" title="Magna cum laude" class="mw-redirect">magna cum laude</a></i> ("with great honor/praise"), <i><a href="/wiki/Summa_cum_laude" title="Summa cum laude" class="mw-redirect">summa cum laude</a></i> ("with highest honor/praise"), and the occasionally seen <i><a href="/wiki/Maxima_cum_laude" title="Maxima cum laude" class="mw-redirect">maxima cum laude</a></i> ("with maximal honor/praise").

Variants include the B.Ed., B.A. Ed, B.A.T. (Bachelor of Arts for Teaching), and B.S.T. degrees. Preparation for the M.S. in education, this degree is most often received by those interested in early childhood, elementary level, and special education, or by those planning to be school administrators. Secondary level teachers often major in their subject area instead (i.e., history, chemistry, or mathematics), with a minor in education. Some states require elementary teachers to choose a subject major as well, and minor in education.</p>
<p>In Canada, the bachelor of education is a two year degree in which students will specialise in either elementary or secondary education, and that is taken after the completion of a three or four year bachelor's degree with a major in a teachable subject, such as English, French, Mathematics, Biology, Chemistry, or a social science. Some universities also offer concurrent, five year programs with student completeting both a bachelor's degree in arts or science as well as their BEd. The possesion of a BEd and a second bachelor's degree is required to teach in most public anglophone and francophone schools in Canada.

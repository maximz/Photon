He has one recurring patient, Tate, who likes Ben's method of pushing his boundaries. Once Tate oversteps his patient boundaries and begins to date Ben's daughter, Violet, Ben discontinues his sessions with Tate. Ben and Vivien's married life becomes strained, due to her difficulty forgiving him for his infidelity. After a heated argument he and Vivien make love. Some time later, a figure in a black latex suit the Harmons discovered in the attic (called "the Rubber Man") appears in the bedroom door.

In "<a href="/wiki/Afterbirth_(American_Horror_Story)" title="Afterbirth (American Horror Story)">Afterbirth</a>", the season one finale, after his wife and daughter die in the house, Ben attempts to escape with his newborn son. He is murdered by Hayden's ghost, when she and the ghosts of the home invaders forcibly hang him from a light fixture. He is presumed by the living to have committed suicide after his wife's death.

Vivien was horrified when her doctor suggests a <a href="/wiki/Hormone_therapy" title="Hormone therapy">hormone therapy</a> to help her heal after the miscarriage. The Harmons agree to move to Los Angeles to start a fresh life and move on from previous events.

She tells Vivien that her womb is "cursed" because three of her four children were born with some sort of deformity (<a href="/wiki/Down_syndrome" title="Down syndrome">down syndrome</a>), and they have all died aside from Adelaide. Constance originally moved from Virginia to California in order to become a movie star, but was not comfortable with doing nudity, so her career never got off the ground. She was soon pregnant with her first child, Adelaide.<sup id="cite_ref-Pilot_3-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Pilot-3"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup> At some point in the late 1970s/early 1980s, Constance and her family moved into the house.<sup id="cite_ref-Piggy_9-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Piggy-9"><span>[</span>9<span>]</span></a></sup> In 1983, she caught her husband, Hugo, attempting to force sex on the maid, Moira, who apparently had allowed him to have sex with her once, and she shot and killed them both.<sup id="cite_ref-Murder_House_5-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Murder_House-5"><span>[</span>5<span>]</span></a></sup> She buried Moira's body in the backyard and grounded Hugo in a meat grinder and fed him to her dogs. At an unknown time, and possibly due to financial hardship as evidenced by the unpaid bills in the beginning of the Birth episode, Constance and her family moved out. The Harvey family moved in next, and Constance began to take advantage of Larry in order to move back into the house. In 1994, Larry told his wife Lorraine of his intentions to divorce her and move the Langdon family back in with him; Lorraine then killed herself and their children in a fire.<sup id="cite_ref-Smoldering_Children_11-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Smoldering_Children-11"><span>[</span>11<span>]</span></a></sup> Not long after, Constance asked Larry to kill her son Beauregard, who was going to be taken away by <a href="/wiki/Child_and_family_services" title="Child and family services">child services</a> due to Constance's neglectful and abusive parenting method of chaining him in the attic.

Out of all the ghosts in the house, Moira is the only one that genuinely cares for Vivien's well-being, and she talks to her frequently to comfort her.

In the next episode ("<a href="/wiki/Murder_House_(American_Horror_Story)" title="Murder House (American Horror Story)">Murder House</a>") it is revealed that she had not gone through with the abortion. She informs Ben that she plans on moving to Los Angeles and expects Ben to divorce Vivien, pay for all of her expenses, and help her raise the child. Hayden is murdered by Larry Harvey. She is buried in the back yard, alongside Moira's body, and Ben builds a gazebo on top of the grave. Since that episode, Hayden appears several times as a ghost to harass the Harmons, particularly in an attempt to drive Vivien crazy enough for her to be admitted for psychiatric treatment, and to stake her claim on one of the unborn babies. After the birth of the babies and Vivien's death, Ben is convinced by Vivien's ghost to leave the house with their only surviving child, before being met at the stairs by Hayden's ghost and the ghosts of the home invaders, Fiona and Dallas. The ghosts forcefully hang Ben from the chandelier, strangling him to death. Constance finds Ben's body, and immediately goes looking for her grandson. She finds him in the basement with Hayden's ghost cradling the living twin in her arms, intent on not allowing anyone to take him. Travis slices her throat (simply a momentary distraction, since both were already ghosts), takes the baby, and gives him to Constance. Later, Hayden tries to convince Tate's ghost that Violet will never acknowledge him again.

Addie would frequently appear inside of or near the house, often giving ominous warnings of death or to play with some of the ghosts on the property. Constance appears to be somewhat abusive towards Addie, such as locking her in a closet full of mirrors if she misbehaves, but is very protective of her and appears to love her regardless.

When the Harmons first view the house, Marcy gives them "full disclosure" of the house's history, but in fact only tells them about the previous tenants being found in the basement as victims of what was believed to be a murder-suicide. The house's past history has caused its price to drop by half of its worth. The Harmons become the new owners. Once strange things happen to the Harmons, including a home invasion, Vivien forces Marcy into putting the house back onto the market as the Harmons intend to move out. Several of the new prospects are heard from again; and one, Larry, comes across as creepy, causing Marcy to pull a handgun on him. When Vivien starts to think the house may be haunted, Marcy believes Vivien is delusional. After the Harmon family dies, she sells the house to a new family, again withholding the history of the house.

Both Chad and Patrick were brought into the basement, and their bodies were staged to appear as a murder-suicide.

<li><span id="Lana_Winters"></span><b>Lana Winters</b> (<a href="/wiki/Sarah_Paulson" title="Sarah Paulson">Sarah Paulson</a>) is an ambitious journalist committed to the asylum after she attempts to expose Briarcliff’s darkest secrets. Lana is in a committed relationship with her girlfriend, Wendy, and they keep their relationship a secret from most people in their life. She first comes to Briarcliff to allegedly write an article about the asylum's bakery, but her true intentions are to interview the killer "Bloody Face", whom she believes is Kit Walker. Sister Jude, suspicious of her intentions, takes an immediate disliking to her, and commits her for her <a href="/wiki/Homosexuality" title="Homosexuality">homosexuality</a> after she is caught in the asylum after hours. Lana is appalled and feels betrayed when she discovers that Wendy allowed her to be institutionalized, but unbeknownst to her Sister Jude actually blackmailed Wendy into committing Lana into the asylum. Whilst in the asylum Lana is subjected to a barbaric form of <a href="/wiki/Aversion_therapy" title="Aversion therapy">aversion therapy</a>. In the episode "<a href="/wiki/I_Am_Anne_Frank" title="I Am Anne Frank">I Am Anne Frank (Part 2)</a>", Dr. Thredson helps Lana escape Briarcliff and holds her captive after revealing himself to be "Bloody Face". He explains that he intends to keep her alive to be the mother he never had as a child and later rapes her. Lana escapes Thredson's lair, only to end up back at the asylum after a car accident. Thredson finds her there, now intent on killing her, but Kit is able to knock him out. Lana wishes to kill him, but Kit needs him to stay alive in order to prove that he is not the killer. Lana learns that she is pregnant from the rape and uses this to get Thredson to confess to being the serial killer, while Kit secretly records him. She attempts to <a href="/wiki/Abortion" title="Abortion">abort</a> the baby, but is unsuccessful. She is able take the tape and escapes the asylum with the help of the Mother Superior, from the urging of Sister Jude. She promises Jude she will someday return the favor by getting Jude released and shutting down the asylum. Lana waits with a gun at Thredson's house, telling him she has turned the tape over to the police, before killing him herself. She later gives birth to the baby and puts him up for adoption. In 1968, she publishes a book about Thredson and her experiences in the asylum, <i>Maniac: One Woman's Story of Survival</i>, which thrusts her into the spotlight and tops the <a href="/wiki/New_York_Times_bestseller_list" title="New York Times bestseller list" class="mw-redirect">New York Times bestseller list</a>. Kit, who has since been freed from the asylum after Thredson's conviction and death, reminds her of the promise made to Jude that she would get the asylum shut down. Lana initially refuses to help. However, three years later, in 1971, she decides to use her status as a well known journalist to bring attention to and shut down the asylum. She sneaks through the tunnel with a film crew and produces a documentary called <i>Briarcliff Exposed</i> which documents the mistreatment of the patients at the asylum. In 2013, Lana is 75 years old and publicly open about her sexuality, and has a new girlfriend. She takes part in an interview, retelling her experiences, and reveals that she had lied about her son dying during birth and that he is still alive. After the interview, she is confronted by her murderous son Johnny, who had posed as a member of the TV crew, although Lana had known he was there the entire time and had been aware that he was the modern-day "Bloody Face". Johnny attempts to kill Lana, in revenge for her attempting to abort him, abandoning him at birth and for not loving his father, whom Johnny idolizes. She ultimately convinces him that he is not like his murderous father and then uses his own gun to kill him, blaming herself for the murders he had committed.

Though she initially appears to be strict with the patients at Briarcliff, she is later shown to be caring and vulnerable. She harbors sexual feelings towards Monsignor Timothy Howard, and has fantasies that they will one day be together, whilst despising Dr. Arden for his power over the asylum and his lack of faith in <a href="/wiki/Christianity" title="Christianity">Christianity</a>. In the episode "<a href="/wiki/Tricks_and_Treats_(American_Horror_Story:_Asylum)" title="Tricks and Treats (American Horror Story: Asylum)" class="mw-redirect">Tricks and Treats</a>", it is revealed that she was once a philandering nightclub singer who unintentionally killed a young girl in a drunk driving accident in 1949. It is later revealed that Sister Jude became a nun because of the car accident. She later discovers, however, that the girl she thought she killed is actually alive and survived the accident. Sister Jude then believes that God has had a plan for her all along, and she decides that it is her duty to put an end to all the inhumane treatments and evil methods being used at Briarcliff. She returns to the asylum to right all the wrongs she's made, but quickly finds herself committed to Briarcliff after being framed for murdering Frank, the security guard. When Mother Superior Claudia visits her in the common room, Jude requests for her to help Lana get out of the asylum as she realizes that she doesn't belong there, and regrets admitting her in the first place. When Lana successfully escapes, she promises Jude that she will return the favor and get Jude released as well. However, when Lana returns less than a year later, she is told by Monsignor Howard that Jude had committed suicide, even though she is shown in solitary confinement. Some years later, Kit Walker sees Jude and visits Lana to insist that she keep her word about getting Jude out, but Lana believes that Jude deserves to be kept in the asylum after all the suffering she's caused. Jude is given the <a href="/wiki/Pseudonym" title="Pseudonym">alias</a> "Betty Drake" in order to hide her identity to ensure she is not freed from the asylum. The Monsignor reveals to Jude that he is being promoted to the position of <a href="/wiki/Cardinal_(Catholicism)" title="Cardinal (Catholicism)">Cardinal</a> of New York, and promises to release Jude as soon as possible, however he never comes back for her. Jude gradually falls deeper into insanity, not realizing it has been almost two years since the Monsignor left the asylum and handed it over to the state of <a href="/wiki/Massachusetts" title="Massachusetts">Massachusetts</a>. In Lana's interview in 2013, she reveals that she tried to find Jude during the filming of her documentary, <i>Briarcliff Exposed</i>, but that she was already gone. It is revealed that Jude had been released from the asylum and taken into the care of Kit, who frequently visited her following Alma's death. Kit helped Jude through the detox of medication given to her while she was at Briarcliff. She seemed to get better, before having a violent episode of insanity. Thomas and Julia took Jude into the woods, where she came back inexplicably healed. Jude taught swing dancing to Kit and the children, while giving the latter life lessons. Lana reveals that six months later, Jude died, succumbing to Shachath's kiss.

She seeks to please everyone, which proves to be a difficult task in the Briarcliff setting. Mary Eunice puts much trust in Dr. Arden, who regularly asks her to deliver buckets of meat to the creatures in the woods, which Arden tells her little about. However, after Jed's exorcism she becomes possessed by the <a href="/wiki/Devil" title="Devil">Devil</a>, and her innocent personality quickly disintegrates as the spirit takes control of her, causing her to become sly and <a href="/wiki/Psychological_manipulation" title="Psychological manipulation">manipulative</a>.

When Jude is removed as head of the asylum, Mary Eunice quickly takes her place. When speaking to the Shachath, the real Mary Eunice manages to break free from the Devil's reign and begs for death, before the Devil quickly regains control and silences her. After Jude hires a <a href="/wiki/Nazi_Germany" title="Nazi Germany">Nazi</a> inspector to find out whether Dr. Arden is a former Nazi scientist, she kills the inspector and keeps some of the evidence to blackmail Arden with. Jude, realising that Mary Eunice has been possessed, intends to kill her, before Mary Eunice locks her in a cell with Leigh Emerson. She frames Jude for the murder of Frank, and admits her into the asylum as a result. Knowing that he is "Bloody Face", she hires Dr. Thredson as a full-time psychologist at the asylum.

Mary Eunice corners the Monsignor on the stairway, before the real, innocent Mary Eunice breaks through from the Devil's reign and releases him, begging for death.

<li><span id="Dr._Oliver_Thredson"></span><b>Dr. Oliver Thredson</b> (<a href="/wiki/Zachary_Quinto" title="Zachary Quinto">Zachary Quinto</a>) is a psychiatrist at Briarcliff Institute whose approach to treatment creates conflict with that of Sister Jude's. He is first brought in to examine Kit to see if he is mentally fit to stand trial, and convinces him to plead guilty in order to avoid the death penalty. Thredson quickly becomes appalled at the dated treatments practiced at the asylum. Sister Jude, having already taken a disliking to him, demands him to leave within two weeks after he accidentally implies that he had planted an old newspaper article on the young girl Jude believes she killed, despite the fact that it had actually been planted by the possessed Mary Eunice. Lana begins to trust Thredson, and asks him to deliver a letter to her girlfriend Wendy. Thredson tells her that when he visited Wendy to deliver the letter, he found her house empty. He decides to help treat Lana's homosexuality through the use of aversion therapy, but abandons the treatment when he concludes that she is sane. Thredson records Kit confessing to the murders, even though he doesn't believe nor remember that he ever committed them. After resigning, Thredson sneaks Lana out of the asylum, leading her to believe that he intends to help her reveal the horrors committed there. After the two arrive at his house, Thredson reveals himself to be "Bloody Face", and informs Lana that he has killed her girlfriend Wendy. Thredson tells her that he was abandoned by his mother as a child and yearns for a "replacement", believing that she is "The One." He keeps her locked up in his basement where he <a href="/wiki/Rape" title="Rape">rapes</a> her. After a failed escape lands Lana back at Briarcliff, Thredson reappears to thwart her plans of exposing his true identity. He explains that no one would believe her due to her mental history, and that he has destroyed all the evidence that could link him to the murders. Lana wants to kill him, but Kit says they have to wait until they can prove that he is the killer, so that Kit can be cleared. They put him in an abandoned storage space where Lana visits him in "<a href="/wiki/The_Coat_Hanger" title="The Coat Hanger">The Coat Hanger</a>". She informs Thredson of her <a href="/wiki/Pregnancy" title="Pregnancy">pregnancy</a>, but threatens to abort it if he doesn't admit to killing the three women. After finishing his confession, Thredson discovers that Kit had taped the whole conversation. Lana later escapes with the tape. Mary Eunice frees Thredson, and she offers him a permanent position at the asylum. Thredson reveals that he intends to murder Lana after she has given birth, only keeping her alive until after she has breastfed the baby. Thredson makes a deal with Kit to help get him out in exchange for the tape. After arriving home, he finds Lana in his house with a gun and she tells him that the police have in fact been given the tape. He seems relieved that his "secret" is out. She mentions that he will now be put to death for his crimes and he scoffs at her, saying that no court will give him the <a href="/wiki/Capital_punishment" title="Capital punishment">death penalty</a> as he is certifiably insane. He tells her that he will spend the rest of his life in prison and she shoots him through the neck, saying prison is too good for him.

Mary Eunice tries to convince the Monsignor to work with her to gain control of the Vatican and offers him the position of&#160;Pope, to which he declines. She then corners the Monsignor on the stairway, before the real Mary Eunice breaks through and lets go of him, begging him for death. The Monsignor quickly pushes her off the stairway, before the Devil can regain control of her body, killing her. After Lana's release from the asylum, he lies to her and the police, telling them that Jude has committed suicide when in reality she is still alive. Monsignor Timothy is later promoted to the position of <a href="/wiki/Cardinal_(Catholicism)" title="Cardinal (Catholicism)">Cardinal</a> of New York and promises Jude that he will bring her with him, but never comes back for her. In "<a href="/wiki/Madness_Ends" title="Madness Ends">Madness Ends</a>", it is revealed that during his days as Cardinal, Lana conducted an exposé which documented Arden's human experiments and the Cardinal's awareness of them. Lana approached Timothy with a camera crew, asking him about his awareness of the experiments. On camera, he denied the allegations before speeding off in his car. It is revealed that he committed suicide later that day by slitting his wrists in a bathtub.</li>

Arden had been working as a physician at Briarcliff since it had been a <a href="/wiki/Tuberculosis" title="Tuberculosis">tuberculosis</a> ward, and he would regularly take away patients with no remaining family members to experiment on. Arden insists that the patients all died of natural causes, which Sister Jude finds suspicious. In actuality, he severely mutilates them before throwing them into the forest surrounding the asylum, feeding them raw meat which Sister Mary Eunice usually delivers. Arden becomes infatuated with Mary Eunice, and remains loyal to her even during her possession. He appears to have a history of violence towards women; when Arden hires a prostitute, she comes across a stash of <a href="/wiki/Third_Reich" title="Third Reich" class="mw-redirect">Third Reich</a> medals and photographs of women in <a href="/wiki/Bondage_(BDSM)" title="Bondage (BDSM)">bondage</a>. He and Sister Jude often clash, as he is regularly fighting for the power she has over the asylum and dismisses her faith. Arden takes a particular interest in Kit after finding a microchip implanted in his body. He attempts to rape Shelley, who laughs at the size of his penis, and in anger he amputates her legs. A patient who believes she is <a href="/wiki/Anne_Frank" title="Anne Frank">Anne Frank</a> is admitted to the asylum, and she publicly identifies Arden as a Nazi doctor called Hans Grüper. Although it is revealed that "Anne" is actually a woman called Charlotte Brown, Sister Jude begins to suspect that Arden could in fact be a Nazi war criminal and hires an investigator. It is revealed that the Monsignor has been aware of Arden's experiments, but after he sees the severely mutilated Shelley in the hospital he understands the full extent of them and is disgusted. Arden insists that they are beneficial to the human race, revealing that through his experiments he has developed humans that can survive a <a href="/wiki/Nuclear_warfare" title="Nuclear warfare">nuclear attack</a>. Sam Goodman, the investigator Sister Jude had hired, discovers that Arden was in fact a Nazi criminal by the name of Hans Grüper. Mary Eunice kills the inspector but keeps some of the evidence to use to blackmail Arden. Together, Arden, Mary Eunice and Leigh frame Jude for the murder of Frank. He performs an experiment with Kit after he believes aliens have taken Grace's body, killing Kit temporarily in order to make the aliens return to save him. The experiment succeeds, and the aliens return with a now-pregnant Grace and Pepper, the latter of which has been given significantly more intelligence. Pepper tells Arden he and his scientific experiments are a joke to the aliens. He later walks with Mary Eunice to feed the Raspers and shoots them all, before attempting suicide by turning the gun on himself. Mary Eunice is unmoved, describing him as "pitiful". When the Monsignor later kills her, Arden insists that she should be cremated. Alone with her body at the furnace, he starts the fire inside, climbs on top of her body, and starts the conveyor to <a href="/wiki/Self-immolation" title="Self-immolation">immolate himself</a>.

She appears to Jude during the exorcism of Jed Potter and accuses her of never getting out of the car. She is reported in a 1949 newspaper article which is delivered to Jude by the possessed Mary Eunice as "missing". During the storm she again plagues Jude with accusations, this time by phone and her shattered glasses are discovered upon the nun's desk, although this is possibly a delusion as a result of Jude's guilt. When Jude goes to the Stone household to confess to the hit-and-run, she learns, to her shock, that Missy is alive and well with a child of her own. Missy survived the hit-and-run with a few broken bones, and her father vowed to get revenge, before her parents agreed it would be best to let the culprit deal with the torment for the rest of their life.</li>

<li><span id="Madison_Montgomery"></span><b>Madison Montgomery</b> (<a href="/wiki/Emma_Roberts" title="Emma Roberts">Emma Roberts</a>) is a spoiled, young Hollywood star who discovers she is a witch and is sent to the Academy. She is the most powerful telekinetic in the coven and proves this after she is gang raped in "<a href="/wiki/Bitchcraft" title="Bitchcraft">Bitchcraft</a>", resulting to her flipping over a bus her rapists were in along with Kyle Spencer, killing most of them on board. However, to return a favor to Zoe, they both bring Kyle back to life. Due to the severe accident of the bus flip, his body parts were scattered and all that was left was his head. Madison decides to put him back together by picking the best parts out of his fraternity brothers. In "<a href="/wiki/The_Replacements_(American_Horror_Story)" title="The Replacements (American Horror Story)">The Replacements</a>", Fiona believes her to be the next supreme after she demonstrates <a href="/wiki/Pyrokinesis" title="Pyrokinesis">pyrokinesis</a> and later concilium (mind control). After a night of heavy drinking, Fiona begs Madison to put her out of her misery, but she refuses and Fiona overpowers her and cuts her throat, leaving her to die on the ground. In "<a href="/wiki/Fearful_Pranks_Ensue" title="Fearful Pranks Ensue">Fearful Pranks Ensue</a>" it is revealed that her body has been added to Spalding's doll collection. Zoe finds her rotting body and Misty helps bring her back to life, but as a result, she cannot feel anything, other than the passion when she is having sex with undead Kyle. This forms a love-triangle with Kyle and Zoe. Madison's main power is <a href="/wiki/Telekinesis" title="Telekinesis" class="mw-redirect">telekinesis</a>, but she later develops the powers of pyrokinesis and with the help of Fiona, concilium. She later develops the power to revive the dead(resurgence) and transmutation. Madison is killed by Kyle, who chokes her to death after she refuses to revive the then-deceased Zoe.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><span id="Misty_Day"></span><b>Misty Day</b> (<a href="/wiki/Lily_Rabe" title="Lily Rabe">Lily Rabe</a>) is a young witch who is not associated with a coven of her own. She is ostracized by her Pentecostal community, and burned alive, but mysteriously revives and spends her time alone walking through the swamps. She is a necromancer with the power of resurgence - allowing her to revive the dead. She is obsessed with <a href="/wiki/Stevie_Nicks" title="Stevie Nicks">Stevie Nicks</a> and believes her to be a white witch. She helps heals Kyle's body after Zoe and Madison end up reviving him. She later ends up using her necromancy on Myrtle Snow after she is burned at the stake. She revives a bird in "<a href="/wiki/Bitchcraft" title="Bitchcraft">Bitchcraft</a>", then later on revives herself after being burnt at the stake. Her powers seem limited based on the amount of time the body has been dead, as observed in "<a href="/wiki/The_Axeman_Cometh_(American_Horror_Story)" title="The Axeman Cometh (American Horror Story)">The Axeman Cometh</a>", when she struggles to revive Madison, who had been dead for weeks. She has also shown minor abilities controlling animals, such as making the crocodiles attack the poachers and also calling the fawn away from Myrtle's charred body. Misty has also demonstrated telekinetic abilities and has also been observed manifesting in other areas at will, potentially demonstrating teleportation ability. Misty dies during The Test of the Seven Wonders in the act of Descensum when she is unable to awaken from the netherrealm. After the test was over her body turned to ash and her spirit remained trapped in her own personal hell.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><span id="Kyle_Spencer"></span><b>Kyle Spencer</b> (<a href="/wiki/Evan_Peters" title="Evan Peters">Evan Peters</a>) is a college student and leader of his fraternity, and Zoe's love interest. He and his single mother were victims of Hurricane Katrina. He is killed at the beginning of the season, when Madison flips over a bus he is riding in. He is later revived in the morgue using a spell cast by Zoe and Madison after his severed head is attached to various body parts from other victims of the crash. However, he suffers some drawbacks- such as rarely being able to speak, and often being slightly confused. He is then brought back home, where it is revealed that his mother has been sexually abusing him. In a fit of rage he bludgeons her to death with a trophy after she tries to sexually abuse him again. Zoe finds Kyle covered in blood, and before she can poison him and end his suffering, he runs away from the house. He reappears in Misty's house deep in the swamp. Misty attempts to bathe Kyle, but he becomes agitated and violent having flashbacks of his mother molesting him. Zoe returns and Misty tells Zoe to take Kyle away from the swamp. Zoe attempts to kill Kyle but cannot bring herself to do it and instead unshackles him. Kyle kills Madison due to her refusal to bring Zoe back to life, and becomes the new butler of the Academy.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><span id="Spalding"></span><b>Spalding</b> (<a href="/wiki/Denis_O%27Hare" title="Denis O'Hare">Denis O'Hare</a>) is the butler of the academy. He has been mute since 1971 when he cut off his own tongue to prevent the witch council's inquisition from finding out the truth about Anna-Lee's murder. He has been in love with Fiona for a long time. Spalding is fond of tea parties and has an extensive doll collection that he plays with while dressing in a woman's night-gown. He adds Madison's body to his collection. He later is interrogated by Queenie, Nan and Zoe about Madison's murder claiming he was responsible though Zoe is skeptical. Later, Zoe recites an incantation, enchanting Spalding's tongue and returning it to his mouth. He admits that Fiona was responsible for murdering Madison due to his tongue being enchanted to tell the truth, and Zoe stabs Spalding in the chest, killing him.</li>

<li><span id="Marie_Laveau"></span><b><a href="/wiki/Marie_Laveau" title="Marie Laveau">Marie Laveau</a></b> (<a href="/wiki/Angela_Bassett" title="Angela Bassett">Angela Bassett</a>) is the mighty high priestess of Voodoo magic. The Voodoo witches are one of the main adversaries of the Salem witches. She is unforgiving to those who wish to hurt her people. She is centuries old and alive in the present, owning a hairdressing salon called Cornrow City in the <a href="/wiki/Ninth_Ward_of_New_Orleans" title="Ninth Ward of New Orleans">Ninth Ward</a>. She claims that the American Salem witches and their descendants were given their powers as a gift from the slave woman, <a href="/wiki/Tituba" title="Tituba">Tituba</a>, before the <a href="/wiki/Salem_Witch_Trials" title="Salem Witch Trials" class="mw-redirect">Salem Witch Trials</a>. She previously signed a truce with then-Supreme Anna-Lee Leighton in the 1970s, but considers Fiona Goode to be her sworn enemy. She later considers the truce to have been broken upon the killing of her lover, Bastien. She sends Bastien to attack the Academy and then her undead army. It is revealed in the fifth episode that she had broken the truce many years ago, hiring the witch hunter Hank to rid the world of Salem descendants. Marie is a powerful Voodoo witch, able to cast rituals of fertility, create potions granting eternal life, and raise the dead. Marie is also the only Voodoo witch to survive Hank's massacre and subsequently seeks sanctuary amongst the witches of the coven. She later reveals her longevity is the result of selling her soul to Papa Legba, a spiritual entity who serves as gatekeeper of sorts between worlds. After forming an unlikely alliance with Fiona Goode, the two witches launch a devastating attack on the witch hunter organisation, ridding themselves of the threat once and for all. She is later attacked and dismembered by Delphine LaLaurie and her body parts are scattered across New Orleans. Unable to fulfil her repayments to Papa Legba, their contract is rendered void and the centuries old voodoo priestess finally dies. She comes to her senses in a hellish afterlife, where is instructed to torture the recently deceased Madame LaLaurie for all of eternity. For her performance, Bassett was nominated for the <a href="/wiki/NAACP_Image_Award_for_Outstanding_Actress_in_a_Television_Movie,_Mini-Series_or_Dramatic_Special" title="NAACP Image Award for Outstanding Actress in a Television Movie, Mini-Series or Dramatic Special">NAACP Image Award for Outstanding Actress in a Television Movie, Mini-Series or Dramatic Special</a>.</li>

<li><span id="Queenie"></span><b>Queenie</b> (<a href="/wiki/Gabourey_Sidibe" title="Gabourey Sidibe">Gabourey Sidibe</a>) is a young inner-city witch who grew up in the foster system in Detroit, where she worked at a fast food restaurant. She is a student at the academy and is described as a human voodoo doll. In the third episode she is attacked by Bastien, and later on dies from her internal injuries. Luckily, Fiona revives her. After Fiona forces Madame LaLaurie to be her personal slave, they form an unlikely friendship despite her racist tendencies. However, after LaLaurie tells Queenie that the other witches do not truly see her as their friend, she turns on the Salem witches, and turns over LaLaurie to Marie Laveau. After, she works at Cornrow City as a receptionist and voodoo assistant, helping Marie with various rituals. Queenie has the ability to transfer pain and injuries inflicted on herself onto anyone else without actual harm coming to herself. She describes herself as "a living <a href="/wiki/Voodoo_doll" title="Voodoo doll" class="mw-redirect">voodoo doll</a>." Queenie proves a special case as it is speculated that she has Voodoo and Salem blood running through her, and she is as much a Salem witch as well as a Voodoo Priestess. She is shot by Hank during the voodoo massacre, however she survives and manages to kill Hank by shooting herself in the mouth. It is later revealed that Queenie survived her wounds, demonstrating a complete resilience to the witch hunter's silver bullets. Her powers have subsequently flourished, and she is seen to have reassembled the dismembered Delphine with relative ease and no scarring. Later still, she demonstrates the ability to descent spiritually into the afterlife and return again and deploys potent telekinetic abilities in saving Misty Day from her entombment and later again during the coven's assault of the Axeman. In the season finale, Queenie (along with Zoe) is appointed the position of Council member by the new Supreme, Cordelia. For her performance, Sidibe was nominated for the <a href="/wiki/NAACP_Image_Award_for_Outstanding_Actress_in_a_Television_Movie,_Mini-Series_or_Dramatic_Special" title="NAACP Image Award for Outstanding Actress in a Television Movie, Mini-Series or Dramatic Special">NAACP Image Award for Outstanding Actress in a Television Movie, Mini-Series or Dramatic Special</a>.</li>

<li><span id="Nan"></span><b>Nan</b> (<a href="/wiki/Jamie_Brewer" title="Jamie Brewer">Jamie Brewer</a>) is a young witch who is a student at the academy and is often underestimated and dismissed by her peers. She has the ability of clairvoyance. She has a crush on Luke. She found, or "heard" Delphine's thoughts from underneath her old estate. She assists in Zoe's interrogation with Spaulding, considering she is the only one who can actually hear him since his tongue has been cut off. Nan is telepathic witch. She can read the minds of others and also see various details of their lives, and has hinted to possess precognitive and retrocognitive abilities. She refers to her mind reading as "hearing", as when the undead army invaded she couldn't hear them. She gives details that she is quite promiscuous and has had a lot of sexual relations with many boys. Nan falls for the neighbour, Luke Ramsey, but her chances of happiness are routinely dashed by the interferences of her fellow witches and Luke's unstable mother, Joan. When Luke is near-fatally shot in an attack by Hank, Nan uses her telepathic abilities to allow Luke and his mother to communicate, but at the same time uncovers Joan's murderous past. Joan later smothers a comatose Luke to keep her secrets buried and cremates his remains. When Nan finds out that Luke is dead and there is no chance of a resurrection, she demonstrates previously unseen telekinetic and mind control abilities, forcing Joan to consume a fatal quantity of bleach and leaves her dead on the kitchen floor. Nan later approaches Marie Laveau after finding a planned child sacrifice crying in a cupboard and exchanges heated words with both the voodoo priestess and Fiona Goode. Later that evening, Nan is drowned by Marie and Fiona in a bathtub as an offering for Papa Legba. The sacrifice is grudgingly accepted and Nan's spirit happily goes into the afterlife with Legba, having had enough of the mortal coil.</li>

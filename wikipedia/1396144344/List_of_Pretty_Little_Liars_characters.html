<p><b>Aria Montgomery</b> (<a href="/wiki/Lucy_Hale" title="Lucy Hale">Lucy Hale</a>) (Season 1 - present) is considered the "alternative" one of the group. She is more outgoing in fashion and what she sees as acceptable behavior. She moves back to Rosewood with her family after living in Iceland for a year. Before Alison's death, she and Alison discovered that Aria's father was having an affair with one of his former students, Meredith, who became his coworker at Hollis College.

She was the "Queen Bee" of Rosewood and the diva of her clique. Ruling the group with an iron fist, the vicious but charismatic Alison went missing during a slumber party at the end of summer, breaking apart the glue that held the clique together. When Aria, Hanna, Spencer, and Emily began receiving threatening messages from "A" a year after Ali went missing, they believe that she's alive and is playing a trick on them. However, shortly after the appearance of "A", "Alison's" body is found buried in the backyard of the former DiLaurentis house, hidden under the gazebo (which had been under construction at the time of her disappearance). The discovery of the body launches a murder investigation. Spencer had thought that Ali was killed with a field hockey stick, but the girls later learn (via police files) that "Alison" was hit in the head with a shovel. However, this wasn't what had immediately killed her. She was buried alive and suffocated to death, as dirt was found in her lungs. In the Season 3 finale, it appears that Alison may not be dead after all, when the girls think they see Alison as Red Coat- the leader of the "A" team. In the Season 4 Summer Finale, its revealed Mrs. Grunwald pulled Alison out of the ground, meaning she did not die that night, but another girl did. The girls find out there are two Red Coats- one is CeCe Drake who is working for "A". They search for the other one, and she appears to be helping the liars. They eventually catch her, and it is indeed Alison. In the Season 4 Spring Finale Alison reveals that "A" knocked her out with a rock whilst Alison's mother watched in horror. Alison's mother then buried her thinking she was dead, meaning her mother was trying to protect her attacker. It is also exposed to the rest of Rosewood that Alison is alive, leading to police questioning the identity of the girl in Alison's grave.</p>

He became romantically involved with Aria after the two met at a bar and instantly bonded. When he discovered that Aria was his student, he attempted to break things off, but found himself unable to do so. He broke up with Aria for a little while in order to take time to think about their relationship. He quit his teaching position at Rosewood just before Noel threatened to expose Aria and Ezra's relationship. Ezra later explains to Aria that he was engaged to a girl named Jackie when he was in college, but that she broke it off; Jackie later returns to Rosewood after getting a teaching position at Hollis. Although Ezra loves Aria, he seems to still have some lingering feelings for Jackie, and the two remain close. His relationship with Aria is often strained by the fact that they have to hide that they are together. Aria, who apparently was a virgin, was surprised dreaming with having relations with Ezra and then confirmed that she was not surprising Ezra with a very sexy dinner and then closing the door of the office. He confesses to Ella that he loves Aria (though she misunderstands and believes he is talking about Spencer) when he comes to comfort Aria after her arrest. In "Through Many Danger, Toils, and Snares" we find out that Aria broke up with Ezra because of Jackie threatening to expose their relationship but they later get back together after Aria explains to Ezra that Jackie was the reason why she broke up with him. Ezra and Aria later tell Byron and Ella that they are a couple which leads him to getting punched by Mike (though it's told he only did it fearing what Byron what would have done instead). Ezra later tells Jackie, who comes into his office trying to convince him it'll never work out for him and Aria due to age difference and the fact she's still a teenager, to get out of his office, saying he will not let her do anything to harm or hurt Aria ever again and that he wants nothing more to do with Jackie herself. Aria continues to attempt to convince her parents to allow her to date Ezra but in the meantime they try to set her up with someone else. When Aria calls Ezra, he tells her not to call him again. The two later rekindle their relationship when Aria leaves him a voice mail telling Ezra that, if he doesn't meet up with her, their relationship is over. Ezra turns up at the last minute after a student tells him to 'be bold' and the two kiss in the rain. Aria decides not to tell her friends that the two are back together, hoping that, by keeping it from them, she can also keep it from 'A'. They later have sex in his apartment after Ezra finds out that he has been fired from Hollis. In season 3, Aria and Ezra celebrate their one-year anniversary. Their relationship seems to be going smoothly until Ezra's younger brother Wesley "Wes" drops by unexpectedly. Bumps are soon formed in their relationship when Aria learns of Ezra getting his high school girlfriend Maggie pregnant and his mother paying her to disappear from his life, even though he wanted to do the right thing. Aria tracks Maggie down and discovers that she has kept the baby, who is now a healthy 7 year old boy whom Ezra finds out about from a distraught Spencer. This leads him to leave Rosewood and seek out Maggie and his son; Ezra is back in Rosewood but only one day after he's back he gets a phone call from Maggie; Mrs.Fitzgerald sold Maggie's condo. Maggie asked Ezra if She and Malcolm can stay in Rosewood near him for a couple of days. When Aria is babysitting Malcolm, Malcolm falls off Ezra's bed and cuts his chin. Aria feels really bad about this. Later when Spencer is part of the A-team, she picks up Malcolm from his karate class but is actually kidnapping him. Aria frantically tries to find him and when she does he tells her that Aria's friend Alison picked him up. Ezra gets a job at Rosewood High as a substitute teacher. After all the incidents with Malcolm, Aria decides that its best that her and Ezra break up just after kissing him on the school stairs. In season four Ezra starts teaching at Rosewood High School again. After Aria has a dream that Ezra got arrested because of her she decided they should see other people, something Ezra had already suggested. Ezra would still do anything for Aria, as whenever she is having trouble he still steps up to help her. Ezra finds out Malcolm isn't really his son.

She ignores Aria's pleas for her to stay away from Byron and in an effort to get close to Byron again, attempts to befriend Ella, who was unaware of the affair. In the beginning of season 3, "A" forces Aria to reveal a past secret that Aria and Alison trashed Byron's office and framed Meredith for the crime when Aria believes an earring she found proves that Byron and Meredith were still together after Aria found out about the affair. After the incident Byron did end all ties with Meredith because he felt threatened. But when "A" forces Aria to confess it was her, it gives now divorced Byron and Meredith another chance at a relationship. When Aria is forced to confess and apologize to Meredith, she returns the earring "A" gave her, which was taken from Alison's grave only to find out the earring is not hers. Meredith became a teacher at Rosewood High. She later was burnt in a fire and lead to believe <i>A</i>ria did it (She's Better Now). In the episode "Misery Loves Company!" it is at first misleading because you think Meredith is actually helping Aria by protecting her from Byron, when in fact she has gone off the deep end. When Aria is sick, Meredith plays mom by taking care of her. When in reality she actually drugs Aria's tea to search her house. After Aria becomes suspicious, Meredith lures Aria down to the basement where she falls and becomes unconscious. When Hanna and Emily check on Aria, they too are tricked down into the basement.

Jackie forces Aria to break up with Ezra but the two later get back together and reveal their relationship to her parents when Ezra overhears Jackie threatening Aria.

Later, Aria calls Ezra for a ride home from Noel's cabin party, and Wesley answers because Ezra left his phone at the apartment with Wesley. He offers to pick Aria up, and on the way home, Wesley reveals to Aria that Ezra had accidentally impregnated a girl named Maggie while in high school, assuming that Ezra had already told Aria this. Wesley goes on to say that Ezra's mother had paid Maggie to stay away from Ezra, and Ezra had never stayed in touch with her.

<p><b>Beatrice "Tris" Prior</b> (In Allegiant also called Six) is the <a href="/wiki/Protagonist" title="Protagonist">protagonist</a> of the Divergent trilogy. The first two books <a href="/wiki/Divergent_(novel)" title="Divergent (novel)">Divergent</a> and <a href="/wiki/Insurgent_(novel)" title="Insurgent (novel)">Insurgent</a> are written from her point-of-view, while the third and final book <a href="/wiki/Allegiant_(novel)" title="Allegiant (novel)">Allegiant</a> is written from both her and Tobias "Four" Eaton's perspectives. Beatrice is born in the Abnegation sector to Andrew and Natalie Prior; she also has an older brother, Caleb Prior. She is described as having a narrow face with grayish-blue eyes and curly blonde hair. She has three ravens tattoos on her collarbone, one representing each of her family members; she also has a Dauntless seal on her left shoulder and an Abnegation seal on her right shoulder.<sup id="cite_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1"><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>In <i>Divergent</i>, she is sixteen years old when she has to take the Aptitude test, which determines which faction a person is most suited for. During the test, Beatrice's test administrator, a woman from Dauntless named Tori Wu, finds out that Beatrice is Divergent and has an aptitude for three factions: Dauntless, Erudite and Abnegation. To save Beatrice from danger, Tori deletes the test results and warns her not to tell anyone about it. During the Choosing Ceremony, Beatrice chooses Dauntless. The new Dauntless initiates board the train. Beatrice meets fellow Dauntless initiates, Christina and Peter, both from Candor. The initiates jump from the train onto a nearby rooftop. Max, one of the Dauntless leaders, meets them and tells them to jump from the rooftop to get to the entrance of the Dauntless compound below. Beatrice is the first to jump. She meets Tobias "Four" Eaton, one of the instructors for the Dauntless initiates, and Eric, another Dauntless leader. Beatrice decides to rename herself "Tris." She later learns that only the top ten initiates will become members; instead of being dejected by the news, she becomes more determined to get through initiation. Tris befriends fellow initiates Will, an Erudite transfer, and Al, from Candor. During Tris's first physical match, she is paired against Peter and is badly beaten. During a game of Capture the Flag, Tris is on Four's team and plays a major part in their team's victory. During knife-throwing practice, she has a row with Eric when he places Al in front of the target despite Al's fear of getting hit by the knives. Eric orders Tris to stand in place of Al while Four throws knives at the target behind her. On visiting day, her mother comes to meet her. Natalie tells her to ask her brother about the Erudite's simulation serum before leaving. Tris realizes her mother was originally from Dauntless. The second phase of initiation involves putting the trainees in simulations of their fears to monitor their response, only ending once they calm down. Tris fears being devoured by crows, but she manages to calm down; she wakes up in a fit and is comforted by Four. During her second simulation, Tris is in a glass box filling with water while her fellow initiates watch and tease her. Tris bangs on the glass until it breaks, and the simulation ends. Because she was able to manipulate the simulation, Four realizes she is Divergent and tells her to hide this or else she may end up dead. She faces four more fear simulations in which she is being burned on a stake by Peter, drowning in the middle of an ocean, watching her family bleed to death and shooting them while she was held at gunpoint. During this time she also finds out through Four that Erudite are planning to attack Abnegation by using Dauntless. At the end of initiation, Tris ranks first. The Dauntless are also injected with another serum which supposedly will help in tracking down people in case of someone going missing but instead it is used to induce a simulation which hypnotizes them to attack the Abnegation. However, since Tris and Four are both Divergent this does not work on them. They try to escape but are caught and presented to Jeanine Matthews, the Erudite leader, who sentences Tris to death while Four is injected with another serum which affects Divergents and sent to oversee the attack from control room. Tris is placed in a real tank filling with water, but she is saved by her mother. Natalie is killed during the escape, and Tris is later forced to shoot Will who tries to attack her while he is under the influence of the simulation. Tris heads back to the Dauntless compound with her father, Caleb and Abnegation leader Marcus Eaton, Four's father. Tris finds Four in the control room. Under the influence of a simulation, Four attacks her but she refuses to kill him. This leads Four to break out of his simulation and stop the Erudite simulation and free the Dauntless. Tris and Four board the train to Amity with the others.</p>
<p>In <i>Insurgent</i>, Tris, Four, Marcus, Caleb and Peter reach Amity sector, where the Abnegation survivors are hiding. She overhears a conversation between Amity leader and Marcus that Abnegation Leaders died protecting a secret. Soon Dauntless and Erudite traitors arrive to capture Abnegation. They recognizes Four's tattoos and during a fight Tris, Four, Caleb, and Susan manage to escape by jumping on a train and meets with Edward who is now a part of factionless and meets their leader Evelyn who is Four's mother. later she and Four go to Candor and their under truth serum influence, she reveals to Four that she has killed Will.<sup id="cite_ref-a_3-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-a-3"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup> She injures Eric, during his attack on Candor. She later surrenders herself to Erudite to save Dauntless, where she finds out that her brother is working for Jeannie but later able to escape with Four and Peter. She joins Marcus Eaton in order to obtain the information stolen by Erudite from Abnegation and transfer it to every faction. When Four finds about that he was shocked and angry at her but they later reconcile and she hopes that they will have no secrets from each other.</p>
<p>Tris dies in <i>Allegiant</i>, after discovering that the US government agency, the Bureau of Genetic Welfare, has decided to wipe the memories of all people in Chicago to prevent the closure of their last experiment and tries to wipe the memories of the board members, initially surviving the death serum, but being shot to death later by David.</p>

He has tattooed the symbol of each faction on his spine, starting from Dauntless at the top, then Abnegation, Amity, Candor and Erudite.

He left the room, when during the training Tris gets beaten by Peter and later says it is "not something I wanted to see," suggesting his feelings for Tris and not wanting to see her hurt. During the knife throwing training, when Tris took Al's place to stand in front of a target, he nicks her ear to show Eric that he does not care about her as they will lead Eric to hurt her as he is jealous of Four since their previous leader Max wanted Four to take his place instead of Eric.

<p><b>Peter</b> is the central <a href="/wiki/Antagonist" title="Antagonist">antagonist</a> in Divergent. He was born in Candor but choose Dauntless as his faction. He is described as having angelic face, dark green color eyes with dark hair. His nose is long with a narrow bridge.</p>
<p>In Divergent, he first appears in the train with Christina and Tris and mocks Tris by calling her "stiff". During the sparring in training activity, he beats Tris until she falls unconscious. Eric chooses him as his team member in <i>capture the flag</i> game. At the last day of their initiation's stage one, he along with Molly, Drew, and some others make fun of Tris's physique, when she heads back to the dorm to fetch her dress as her pants does not fit her anymore because of her new muscles. Peter yanks her towel off and they laugh and make fun of her. When stage one's results come out and Edward comes first followed by Peter, Peter in his jealousy stabs Edward in the eye with a knife that night. But Tris and Christina decide not to report him as they know that Dauntless will not do anything to Peter. When Tris comes first for the second stage of initiation, he does not take it well at all and turns Tris's friends against her by accusing her of manipulating others to seem weak and achieving better results. He then kidnaps Tris along with Al and Drew, gropes her and hangs her over the chasm until Four comes to her rescue, supposedly in a mere attempt to scare her rather than kill her. He is one of the few people who is not under simulation controlled by Erudite because of his already violent nature and encounters Tris, Andrew, Caleb and others when they return to stop the simulation where Tris shoot him in the arm. He agrees to help them stop the simulation if the party will take him with them to Amity due to his fear that he will get killed because of his knowledge of computers controlling the simulations.</p>
<p>In Insurgent, he appears at Amity with others, still suffering from the bullet wound. Later he steals the Erudite disk from Tris's room but later get caught and beaten up by Tris. During the Erudite and Dauntless traitors attack on Amity, Tris saves his life. When Tris surrenders herself to Erudite, she find out that after the attack on Amity, Peter has joined the Erudite and he is assigned as her guard. He fakes her death and later helps her and Four escape from Erudite. He arrives at Abnegation where factionless and Dauntless are staying and Edward confronts him. He later declines to join other in their invasion at Erudite.</p>
<p>In Allegiant, Tobias gives him the memory serum so he can reset his memory as he is sick of being so mean and cruel and wants to change.</p>

Later on the train back to Dauntless, he makes acquaintances with Tris by squirting a paintball in her face and talks to her along with Marlene. He also invites Tris to join him and other Dauntless-born initiates for an initiation ritual and after that she becomes friend with Uriah and some other Dauntless-born initiates. Christina, Al, and Will do not take Tris's friendship with them well. He later invites Tris to training room to celebrate after she comes first in the second stage of initiation.

It does not knock out him like others and Tris finds out that he is Divergent like her. When Zeke and Tori return and reveal that they were actually spying on Erudite, he does not show surprise because he and Shauna already know their plan. He and Marlene start flirting with each other, which irritates Lynn. At Dauntless compound, she tells them to just come out with their relationship and in answer to her, Marlene kisses him. He becomes greatly depress, when Marlene becomes the victim of the new serum of Jeannie Matthews (which Eric releases at Candor) by killing herself. He later strongly opposes the idea of surrendering any Divergent to Erudite for the safety of those who are containing the serum in their bodies. He escorts Tris down after Tori accuses her of being a traitor but does not act differently or negatively to her and tells her that he has to shoot many people to get inside the building. Lynn gets shot in the stomach and is carried to the floor he and Tris are in. He brings a doctor for her but could not save her. Before dying Lynn reveals to him that she was in love with Marlene.</p>
<p>Uriah dies in Allegiant from serious injuries to his brain caused by an explosion. Tobias was a part of the group who set the explosion off. Tobias partly blames himself for Uriah's death and was troubled because he promised Zeke that he would protect Uriah, which he was unable to do. Uriah was in a coma and the doctors said he would not wake up. They were going to turn off his life support straight away but Christina pleaded with them so they agreed for four more days, so that his family could be informed. He dies towards the end of the book and his family (mom and his brother) are with him as he gets unplugged.</p>

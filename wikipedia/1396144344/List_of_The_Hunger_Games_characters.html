<p><b>Katniss Everdeen</b> is the <a href="/wiki/Protagonist" title="Protagonist">protagonist</a> of the series. She is sixteen years old at the beginning of the first book, and is portrayed as quiet, independent and fierce. She has long dark hair (which she wears in a single braid down her back), olive skin, and grey eyes.<sup id="cite_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1"><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></a></sup> She lives with her mother and Primrose, her younger sister, in District 12, a coal-mining district and one of the poorer districts of <a href="/wiki/The_Hunger_Games_universe#Panem" title="The Hunger Games universe">Panem</a>. Food is scarce in District 12 and Katniss hunts illegally to feed her family and to supplement their meager income. Her father was killed in a mining explosion when she was younger, and her mother fell into a deep depression. Throughout her life, she became hunting partners and best friends with Gale Hawthorne, who is also from her District and whose father was killed in the same mining accident as Katniss's.</p>
<p>At the <a href="/wiki/The_Hunger_Games_universe#The_Reapings_and_Preliminaries" title="The Hunger Games universe">reaping</a> for the 74th Annual <a href="/wiki/The_Hunger_Games_universe#The_Hunger_Games" title="The Hunger Games universe">Hunger Games</a>, Katniss's sister Prim's name is pulled by District 12 chaperone, Effie Trinket, but Katniss volunteers to take her sister's place. During the presentation of the tributes, her designer, Cinna, includes live flames in her costume, giving her the nickname "[the] Girl on Fire". During the pre-Game interviews, Peeta, Katniss's fellow tribute from District 12, expresses his love for her on live television. Katniss assumes it is a ploy to gain attention from wealthy sponsors. Later, she begins to believe that his love is real, though she is uncertain of her own feelings. During the Games, Katniss forms a genuine friendship with Rue (District 11 tribute), a 12-year old girl who reminds Katniss of her sister. After the two form an alliance and a plan to destroy their enemies' supplies, things go awry and Rue is killed with a spear by Marvel from District 1, whom Katniss promptly shoots with her signature bow and arrow. Halfway through the Games, a new rule is instituted allowing both tributes from a district to become victors. Katniss and Peeta work together, eventually killing the last tribute, Cato (District 2). However, instead of being announced victors, the rule is revoked and only one winner is to be allowed. Katniss decides that they should eat poisonous <a href="/wiki/The_Hunger_Games_universe#Nightlock_.28berry.29" title="The Hunger Games universe">nightlock</a> berries, killing themselves and leaving the Games with no winner. As a result, Seneca Crane hastily ends the Games, and declares both Katniss and Peeta as winners. This is seen by the Capitol's people as an act of undying love, but is seen by Capitol officials and rebels in many districts as an act of defiance. The act makes Katniss a symbol of rebellion for the Districts against the Capitol. Upon returning to District 12, Katniss becomes aware of her indifference of feelings towards Peeta.</p>
<p>Months later, Panem's leader, President Snow, visits Katniss in her home before the annual <a href="/wiki/The_Hunger_Games_universe#Victory_Tour" title="The Hunger Games universe">victory tour</a>. It is revealed that her and Peeta's actions that helped them win the previous games was seen as an act of rebellion and caused a few uprisings in some of the districts. In order to calm the situation, Snow suggests Katniss convince the country of her and Peeta's love. By the end of the victory tour, with the country still seemingly unconvinced, Snow announces the 75th Hunger Games (the country's third <a href="/wiki/The_Hunger_Games_universe#Quarter_Quell" title="The Hunger Games universe">Quarter Quell</a>) in which all tributes are to be selected from the existing pool of victors. Being the only living female victor from District 12, Katniss is again reaped to compete in the games, alongside Peeta, who volunteers after their previous mentor, Haymitch Abernathy's name is called. During these games, Katniss and Peeta ally themselves with Beetee and Wiress (District 3), Finnick Odair and Mags (District 4), and Johanna Mason (District 7). Mags and Wiress are killed, however the remaining allies make it to the final 7, along with Brutus and Enobaria (District 2). After a plan suggested by Beetee to electrocute the remaining two tributes goes awry, Katniss blows up the arena by shooting an arrow at the force field, which had an electrical wire attached to it. Katniss, Finnick, and Beetee are rescued from the arena by the rebels and taken to <a href="/wiki/The_Hunger_Games_universe#District_13" title="The Hunger Games universe">District 13</a>, though the remaining alliance members Peeta and Johanna are taken by the Capitol.</p>
<p>Upon regaining the majority of her mental and physical stability, the rebels approach Katniss about becoming the "Mockingjay" of the revolution. She eventually agrees and assists by filming short promos that are aired throughout the districts. After going through training, she is sent on a mission to the Capitol to carry out President Snow's assassination, alongside Gale and Finnick Odair. Peeta, who was successfully rescued from the Capitol, joins them. The Capitol injected Peeta with tracker jacker venom, causing him to forget a lot, including his feelings towards Katniss. When they first reunite in District 13, he tries to kill her. He is sent to join the mission to the Capitol, however, after weeks of counseling and attempts to set him straight again. The majority of the rebels in Katniss's crew is killed along the way to President Snow's mansion. A bomb goes off, killing her sister, who was in the Capitol to nurse the wounded rebels back to health. Katniss is left burned from the bombing near the President's mansion, right before the end of the war. She is rescued and nursed back to her own health, while informed that the rebels won the war and have President Snow's execution set, to be carried out by Katniss herself. After speaking with President Snow, she realizes that it was President Alma Coin of District 13 (who has also become the new president of Panem since Snow's capture), who ordered the bombing that killed Prim. At the execution, instead of shooting her arrow at President Snow, she kills Coin to avenge Prim's death and prevent someone as brutal as Coin from taking Snow's place. After being excused for Coin's murder, as she was still seen as mentally unstable, Katniss is sent back to District 12. In the epilogue, set fifteen years after the end of the story, it is implied that she has married Peeta, and they have two children, one girl and one boy.</p>

<p><b>Peeta Mellark</b> is the male tribute from District 12, in both the 74th and 75th Hunger Games. He is a baker's son. He is quite charismatic, which helps him during the Games. He states in an interview after the Reaping that he has been in love with Katniss since the first day he saw her. His relationship with Katniss grows throughout the story.</p>
<p>During <i>The Hunger Games</i>, Peeta is certain that Katniss will win because of her experience in hunting. Peeta defends Katniss, and even declares his love for her on public television. Though Peeta is sincere, Katniss does not truly return Peeta's affections; she initially believes he is simply trying to curry favor with the public and with the sponsors, and she still has very strong feelings for Gale. At the end of the Games, they are the last two tributes remaining. The revision to the rules, which allowed two tributes to become victors if they originated from the same district, was revoked in an attempt for a more dramatic, and therefore audience-pleasing, ending. But rather than fight to the death, Peeta and Katniss threaten suicide with nightlock berries, forcing the Gamemakers to declare both of them victors. After the Games, it was revealed that Peeta had contracted blood poisoning from a wound he sustained in the Arena. Though Katniss had saved him in the Arena, he underwent surgery following the Games. The damage resulted in the loss of his left leg, forcing Peeta to use a prosthetic leg. Peeta is nicknamed "Lover Boy" by the Careers because of his love for Katniss.</p>
<p><i>Catching Fire</i> opens with Peeta being "icy" and "unreachable", believing that the affection Katniss showed during the previous year's Games was a ploy. When President Snow announces the Third Quarter Quell, Peeta makes a deal with Haymitch to keep Katniss alive and safe – he volunteered himself, in Haymitch's place, in order to protect Katniss. He lies to the Capitol in an effort to try to save Katniss from returning to the Games by saying that they are married and that she is pregnant. During the Third Quarter Quell, Peeta and Katniss are part of the group that destroys the Arena. While rebels from District 13 rescue Katniss, Peeta is captured by Capitol forces.</p>
<p>In <i>Mockingjay</i>, he is tortured physically and mentally in an attempt to reveal information regarding Katniss and her whereabouts. Although he and others are eventually rescued, the Capitol tampered with his memories by using <a href="/wiki/The_Hunger_Games_universe#Tracker_jackers" title="The Hunger Games universe">tracker jacker</a> venom – a process called "hijacking" – which leaves him frightened and unstable. Believing that Katniss is a muttation, and remembering only a twisted version of their experiences in the Games, Peeta attempts to kill Katniss, but fails. With help from District 13 doctors, Prim, and other friends, he slowly begins to regain parts of his real memories, although the process is overwhelming and tedious for him. President Coin sends him on the final mission into the Capitol with the squad of soldiers that includes Katniss, Gale, and Finnick, where he struggles with his memories and mental trauma. It is believed President Coin's intent was for Peeta to become insane and kill Katniss, turning her into a martyr. However, Peeta manages to prevent this from happening, even insisting that he be handcuffed constantly in case he loses control and hurts someone. Realizing the danger in which he puts the group and the difficulty he causes them, he asks to be killed when it seems that he will lose control and try to kill Katniss. Katniss fiercely refuses and kisses him, which seems to make him stable. Peeta later votes not to have another Hunger Games (featuring children of the Capitol as tributes) to avenge the children that participated in previous years. When the war ends, Peeta survives and eventually returns to District 12 with Katniss. Later he and Katniss marry, and have two children – a girl and a boy – who are able to live in a world without the Hunger Games.</p>
<p>Peeta is 16 years old in The Hunger Games and 17 years old in Catching Fire and Mockingjay. He has a talent for art (he tells Katniss he was responsible for decorating the cakes at his family's bakery) and reveals that his favorite color is orange. When he is recovering his memory after he was "hijacked," Katniss reminds him that he likes the soft kind of orange like the sunset, not the bright kind.</p>

<p><b>Gale Hawthorne</b> is an 18-year-old boy who lives in District 12. He is Katniss's best friend and her hunting partner. They meet while Katniss is attempting to hunt to feed her family following their fathers' deaths. Gale is described by Katniss as muscular and very handsome, and catches the attention of girls in District 12. Both Gale and Katniss bear the typical resemblance of those from the Seam; dark hair, olive skin, and grey eyes. He has three younger siblings and is skilled with snares and hunting with bow and arrow.</p>
<p>In the second book, <i>Catching Fire</i>, Katniss returns to District 12, but their relationship cannot continue as it was, since Katniss and Peeta must play the part of lovers due to threats from the Capitol. Gale confesses his love for Katniss after she asks him to run away with her. Soon after, he is brutally whipped in public for hunting on Capitol land. He and Katniss prepare to fight as it becomes clear that a rebellion is about to begin. However, Katniss, along with Peeta, are selected for the Third Quarter Quell and must leave District 12 to return to the Games. Once again, Gale is forced to say goodbye to Katniss as she prepares for a fight to the death.</p>
<p>In <i>Mockingjay</i>, Gale fights in the rebellion in an epic war. District 12 is destroyed, and Gale leads approximately 10% of the population to safety. The survivors are forced to move to what is left of District 13. Once the people of District 13 are aware of Gale's heroism, they reward him with a higher ranking and a communicuff (which is later taken from him as punishment for helping Katniss in the war). Toward the end of the book, his relationship with Katniss deteriorates because he feels responsible for the death of Prim, Katniss's sister (caused by a bomb he had constructed). He mentions that he would always remind Katniss of Prim's death, which Katniss silently agrees with. Afterwards, Gale decides to remain in District 2.</p>

<p><b>Haymitch Abernathy</b> is a "paunchy, middle-aged man" who was the victor of the 50th Hunger Games (the Second Quarter Quell), which occurred 24 years prior to the first book.<sup id="cite_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup> When he was 15, Haymitch was reaped for the Second Quarter Quell, where four tributes from each district were forced into the arena. He became an ally to a girl named Maysilee Donner, who was the original owner of Katniss's symbolic mockingjay pin, but was later forced to watch her die. During the Games, he discovered a wall of shrubbery at the edge of the Arena that concealed a force field, which ricocheted anything thrown in its direction. During the final moments of the Games, Haymitch (severely wounded himself) positioned himself by the edge, knowing that when his opponent flung her weapon at him, he could duck and the force field would hurl it back at her. His plan was successful, leaving Haymitch the victor. Within two weeks of his victory, Haymitch's mother, younger brother, and girlfriend were killed by President Snow as punishment for Haymitch using the force field to his advantage. Haymitch became an example of what happens to those who defy the Capitol.</p>
<p>After his victory, he became an alcoholic and has spent almost all of the next 24 years intoxicated. Being the only surviving victor from District 12 (one of only two in the history of the Games), Haymitch was forced to mentor all of its tributes, which consumed him with guilt by being forced to participate in the Games that he hated. He dealt with these feelings with alcohol and openly flouting the dignity of the games. He treats Peeta and Katniss with contempt and is sarcastic, expending no effort to help them. However, when Katniss confronts him, he is stirred from his stupor and emerges as the pair's greatest advocate, impressed by her determination and Peeta's patience. Haymitch shows himself to be highly canny as he guides his protégés in a cleverly designed, highly unorthodox strategy aimed at ensuring the survival of both tributes.</p>
<p>In the book <i>Catching Fire</i>, the liquor supply in District 12 runs out. As a result, Haymitch suffers from <a href="/wiki/Alcohol_withdrawal" title="Alcohol withdrawal" class="mw-redirect">alcohol withdrawal</a>. It is left to Katniss and Peeta to coax him back to health (and get him more liquor). After this incident, Katniss begins to develop a true affection and respect for him. When Katniss discovers that Haymitch and his allies from District 13 and the Capitol failed to save Peeta from the arena as they did for her, she claws him in the face. In <i>Mockingjay</i>, Haymitch is forced to go through <a href="/wiki/Drug_detoxification" title="Drug detoxification">detox</a> in District 13, as they do not permit the consumption of alcohol. After this, he continues to serve as a mentor to Katniss and Peeta; however, he never truly repairs his relationship with either of them, and goes back to his drinking after the war ends. Haymitch and Katniss, despite nearly always working towards the same goals, are usually hostile towards one another, because they have similarly prickly personalities; also, Katniss and Peeta both resent Haymitch for keeping information from both of them, sometimes at the request of the other.</p>

<p><b>Primrose Everdeen</b>, an <a href="/wiki/Ingenue_(stock_character)" title="Ingenue (stock character)">ingénue</a> character, nicknamed "<b>Prim</b>", is Katniss's younger sister. She was 12 years old in <i>The Hunger Games</i> and presumably 13 years old in <i>Catching Fire</i> and <i><a href="/wiki/Mockingjay" title="Mockingjay">Mockingjay</a></i>. Like her mother, she has blonde hair and blue eyes.</p>
<p>Prim is thoughtful and sweet. She is a skilled healer, having been taught by her mother. In <i>Mockingjay</i>, Prim is singled out by District 13 to be trained as a doctor. During <i>Catching Fire</i> and <i>Mockingjay</i>, Katniss sees a change in her personality, as she has become more solemn and mature. Katniss stated in the books that Prim is "the only person I'm certain I love."</p>
<p>At the Reaping for the 74th Hunger Games, Prim's name is pulled by Effie Trinket to be the female tribute for District 12. Katniss volunteers to take her place in the Games. As she leaves for the Capitol, Prim makes Katniss promise to try hard to win the Games. This promise guides many of Katniss's actions in the game, while Katniss's sacrifice for Prim making her a popular symbol in the Capitol as people love the story, prompting some to note that the Capitol will never threaten Prim to get to Katniss because of the potential outcry.</p>
<p>In <i>Mockingjay</i>, Prim is sent by President Alma Coin into the rebellion battle against the Capitol to serve as a casualty nurse. During this battle, Prim is killed in a bombing, causing Katniss to fall into a deep depression. President Snow later reveals to Katniss that the bombing was planned by the rebels to galvanize public opinion against the Capitol to make people think that the Capitol caused the accident, and then had timed a second explosion to detonate when the medical corps arrived to assist survivors. Katniss had been told by Gale that this was a strategy being contemplated by the rebels. Knowledge of this information leads Katniss to execute President Coin, instead of President Snow.</p>

<p><b>Finnick Odair</b> is the male tribute from <a href="/wiki/The_Hunger_Games_universe#District_4" title="The Hunger Games universe">District 4</a> who was reaped into the Third Quarter Quell. He is 24 years old and described as being very handsome, muscular, athletic and tall with tan skin, bronze hair, and stunning sea-green eyes. He is very popular among the people of the Capitol, and is known as a Sex Symbol for having many female lovers in the Capitol, none of whom he stays with for long. At age 14, he won the 65th Hunger Games by using a <a href="/wiki/Trident" title="Trident">trident</a> and a net against other tributes (a skill unique to District 4's trade of fishing). Katniss remarks that the trident given to him by a sponsor may have been the most expensive gift ever seen in the Games. During the Quarter Quell, Katniss is hesitant to make Finnick her ally, because she does not trust him — to her, he appears to be shallow, arrogant, and superficial. However, Finnick soon proves to be trustworthy by saving Peeta by using <a href="/wiki/CPR" title="CPR" class="mw-redirect">CPR</a> to resuscitate him (which Katniss notes as, "one of the things I will never stop owing him for"), and using his skills to provide shelter. When jabberjays that make sounds of the screams of loved ones being tortured appear in the Quell, the one made to target Finnick uses the voice of Annie Cresta, his "poor, mad" lover in District Four, who was also a victor of the Games. In <i>Mockingjay</i>, Finnick enters a deep depression, a result of Annie being held prisoner by the Capitol. He assists with the rebellion by appearing in rebel propaganda. He later reveals that victors of the Games are often prostituted to wealthy citizens of the Capitol by President Snow, which resulted in his reputation of many lovers. He also reveals all of the political secrets he learned from clients, including the fact that President Snow only became the leader of Panem through poisoning his opponents. He is reunited with Annie (when District 13 retrieves her, Johanna, and Peeta from the Capitol), and they get married. Finnick is a member of the "Star Squad" that goes to fight in the Capitol during the final stages of the rebellion. He is decapitated by lizard <a href="/wiki/The_Hunger_Games_universe#Rose-scented_reptiles" title="The Hunger Games universe">muttations</a> during the attempt to infiltrate the Capitol. Some months after his death, Annie has their son. Finnick is characterized as being personable, very good-looking, and down-to earth, with a quirky sense of humor. After an initial period of distrust, he and Katniss become good friends.</p>

<p><b>Johanna Mason</b> is the female tribute from <a href="/wiki/The_Hunger_Games_universe#District_7" title="The Hunger Games universe">District 7</a>. Sarcastic and rebellious, Johanna's first meeting with Katniss involves her stripping naked out of her tree costume in order to make Katniss uncomfortable. She reveals that she has no friends or family in District 7 during the 75th Hunger Games, stating "there is no one left I love." She won her original Hunger Games by pretending she was a weakling and a coward, so no one regarded her as a threat, but when only a few tributes remained, she revealed herself as a vicious killer. Johanna teams up with Katniss, Peeta, and Finnick in the Quarter Quell, bringing Beetee and Wiress with her. Johanna takes part in the committee to keep Katniss and Peeta alive, and helps by protecting Katniss throughout the Games. Near the end of <i>Catching Fire</i> she removes the tracker in Katniss's arm by cutting it out with a knife. Johanna is captured by the Capitol at the end of <i>Catching Fire.</i> In the third book, she is rescued along with Peeta and Annie and brought to District 13, where she fights with rebel forces and improves her friendship with Katniss. She is to fight in the Capitol with Katniss (although not as a sharpshooter — being from an area where lumber is the main export, her main weapon is the axe) but during training in District 13 she panics when the training arena is deliberately flooded as she has developed a fear of water as a result of her Capitol torture: being soaked in water and given electric shocks. Because she and Katniss refuse to be held in the District 13 hospital to treat their supposed mental illnesses, they convince the officials of District 13 to let them room together. Johanna is part of the committee that votes whether or not to hold one last Hunger Games using the Capitol's children: she votes yes.</p>

<p>The primary <a href="/wiki/Antagonist" title="Antagonist">antagonist</a> of the series, <b>President Coriolanus Snow</b> is the <a href="/wiki/Autocracy" title="Autocracy">autocratic</a> ruler of the Capitol and all of Panem. Though seemingly laid-back, his demeanor hides a sadistic and psychopathic mind.<sup id="cite_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5"><span>[</span>5<span>]</span></a></sup> He initially appears in <i>The Hunger Games</i> at the opening of the Games giving the official welcome, but he does not speak to Katniss face-to-face until <i>Catching Fire</i>, when he pays her a visit at home and tells her that he is angry that both she and Peeta were allowed to survive the Hunger Games, as their act of defiance (preferring joint suicide to the prospect of one killing the other) has ignited rebellion in several of the Districts. She is too prominent to kill, but he threatens her family and Gale unless she proves to the Districts that her act of saving Peeta was merely that of a love-crazed teenager and was not related to any desire to defy the Capitol.<sup id="cite_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6"><span>[</span>6<span>]</span></a></sup> Later, Snow indicates to her that she failed in this, meaning that some or all of his threats will come true. President Snow is described as having very puffy lips, which are most likely the result of an appearance-altering operation that is very popular in the Capitol. Katniss describes him as exuding a smell of blood and roses.<sup id="cite_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7"><span>[</span>7<span>]</span></a></sup> In <i>Mockingjay</i>, it is revealed that the smell of blood is due to mouth sores he got from one of the poisons that he used to kill people in his monomaniacal efforts to control Panem. He drank the poison in order to allay suspicions, then took the antidote, but they could not cure him of the sores. He also smells strongly of genetically enhanced roses, as he always wears a white rose in his lapel to cover the scent of blood. The strong smell invariably makes Katniss gag. He is said to have prostituted winning tributes, like Finnick Odair, forcing them to have sex with wealthy Capitol citizens, under threat of killing their loved ones if they refused. Snow claims he only kills for a purpose, and he promises Katniss he will always tell her the truth. Whether these assertions are true or not is left up to interpretation by Katniss. He dies at the end of <i>Mockingjay</i>, after Katniss shot President Coin instead of him, though the rebels are unable to determine whether it was by choking to death on his own blood from his untreated mouth sores or because he was trampled by the mob in the panic following the assassination of President Coin.</p>

<p><b>Effie Trinket</b> is a Capitol-born chaperone who was assigned to oversee District 12's tributes in the Hunger Games, specifically Katniss and Peeta in the 74th and 75th games. She must carry out such tasks as drawing the tributes' names at the reaping and escorting them to the Capitol. At first, she detests her association with District 12 and hopes to be promoted to a better, richer district after she pays her dues for a few years. Later, Effie becomes attached to her District 12 charges, though it's unclear if this is because of their particular charms, or because of their fame and success, which reflect well upon her. She does not have any moral qualms about the Hunger Games or the Capitol and appears totally oblivious to the misfortunes of District 12. She does not appear to be very intelligent, and gets basic facts wrong, such as confusing how diamonds and pearls are made. Effie always seems to wear wigs of different colors for different "special" occasions. She is very strict about manners and is always punctual. In <i>Mockingjay</i>, it is said that she was imprisoned after Katniss's escape, but, unlike many others Katniss knew in the Capitol, she is not executed. She meets up again with Katniss before Snow's execution and Katniss notes that she has a "vacant look" in her eyes.</p>

<td>Katniss's mother. She was raised in town as the daughter of an apothecary, and consequently had a fairly comfortable life. During the 50th Hunger Games (2nd Quarter Quell) reaping, she and Madge's mother were clinging on Maysilee Donner, Madge's aunt and Ms. Everdeen's friend, who was reaped and killed at the time. She gave it all up to marry Katniss's father and move to the Seam, where she lived in poverty. She falls into a deep depression when her husband dies in a mining accident. She does not talk for quite a while, causing Katniss to step up and be Prim's caretaker. She eventually recovers enough to set up an apothecary in District 12, but it is not until after her first Hunger Games that Katniss finally forgives her mother for not offering any support to her and Prim during her depression. In <i>Mockingjay</i> she is seen working in the hospital in District 13, and following Prim's death at the end of the book, she does not return to District 12 with Katniss. Instead, she stays in District 4, working in a hospital and coping with her grief. She and Katniss maintain contact through telephone calls.</td>

Katniss later learns that the pin had belonged to Madge's aunt, Maysilee Donner, a Tribute in the 50th Hunger Games and twin to Madge's mother, who became allies with Haymitch for some time. Katniss and Madge spend more time together during the months after the Games. Katniss is at Madge's house when she first hears of the uprisings in District 8 on the mayor's television in his room. She and her family perish in the District 12 bombings. Madge is not included in the film adaptations.</td>

Memories of him run through Katniss's mind throughout the series, with Katniss mentioning such features of him as his singing voice, his handsomeness, and the things he taught her. Peeta's father says that although he was in love with Katniss's mother, she chose to marry Katniss's father because of his lovely singing voice. Katniss recalls that when he sang, "all the birds stopped to listen". (Which is one of the memories that Peeta responds successfully to.) She misses him terribly, and the pain of losing him almost destroyed Mrs. Everdeen. He is depicted through <a href="/wiki/Flashback_(narrative)" title="Flashback (narrative)">flashbacks</a> in the films.</td>

Her parents, who hid in the shoe shop during the bombing, were not so lucky as Katniss describes. She is first mentioned in "The Hunger Games", when Peeta, trying to explain Katniss's reaction in recognizing an Avox as someone she met on a hunting trip, fibs that the Avox is a "dead ringer for Delly". In <i>Mockingjay,</i> after Peeta is rescued from the Capitol, Delly is used as a psychological "balm" to stir his childhood memories and help begin his recovery from the mind-control tortures the Capitol inflicted upon him. In the same book, it was revealed that Delly and Peeta used to do chalk drawings on paving stones and Peeta's father used to let them make dough people.</td>

<td><span id="Greasy_Sae"></span><b>Greasy Sae</b></td>

<td>Greasy Sae is an old woman who sells bowls of soup from a large kettle at The Hob in District 12. Katniss Everdeen and Gale Hawthorne trade with her often, and make a conscious effort to keep on good terms with her as she could be counted on to buy wild dog, which most of their other customers decline. Greasy Sae started a collection to sponsor Peeta and Katniss during the 74th Hunger Games, with some people chipping in. She also has a granddaughter described as "not quite right" who is generally treated as sort of a pet by people in the Hob, who give her scraps of food from their stands. At the end of the book, Greasy Sae is one of the few hundred people to return to District 12 following the war. When Katniss returns to District 12 after the war, Greasy Sae comes over in the morning and evening to cook and do light housekeeping. It is unclear whether she is doing this out of friendship or if she has been paid. Greasy Sae is not directly mentioned in the Hunger Games movie, but a character who is presumably her is seen dealing with Katniss. She gives the mockingjay pin to Katniss in the movie, although in the book, it was given to her by Madge.</td>

He is often found in the Hob, the black market of District 12, where he buys illegal alcohol and game from Gale and Katniss. Although lenient with the law, he is also known to abuse his position by luring starving young women into his bed in exchange for a small amount of money. Katniss claims that if she had not learned to hunt, she would have been one of those women.</td>

After breaking the alliance with Haymitch, she is killed by a large number of bright, "candy-pink birds," who use their razor sharp beaks to fatally wound her in the neck.

Although he did not escape with Prim and Mrs. Everdeen, Katniss found him when she revisited District 12 and brought him back. He is said to dislike District 13, due to its underground location and lack of fresh air. After Prim's death and the end of the war, he makes his way back to District 12 on foot, and is found again by Katniss. The two mourn over Prim's death in <i>Mockingjay,</i> and end up comforting each other (it is hinted they are starting to come to love each other).</td>

After designing the spectacular outfits of the opening ceremony, which include igniting Katniss and Peeta's costumes with synthetic fire, he nicknames Katniss "the Girl On Fire." Cinna is in his first year as a stylist for the Games, and specifically requested to be assigned to District 12. His amazing designs immediately win over the audience in favor of the District 12 tributes. Despite (or perhaps because of) his professional interest in image, Cinna proves to be better than most at seeing through the superficial spectacle of the Games to their barbaric core, "using [her] outfits as a vehicle to express potentially dangerous ideas."<sup id="cite_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-12"><span>[</span>12<span>]</span></a></sup> He and Katniss establish an easy, comfortable relationship and he demonstrates a genuine concern for her well-being. In <i>Catching Fire</i>, Cinna dresses her for her interview in her wedding dress, as insisted by President Snow, but alters it so that when Katniss raises her arms and twirls at her interview, the white dress burns away to be replaced with a black dress of feathers that resembles a mockingjay, which has become the symbol of the resistance in Panem. Because of this, Cinna is savagely beaten in front of Katniss, right before she enters the arena for the Quarter Quell, which unnerves her greatly. It is suggested that he might have been tortured to death after the arena explodes. Cinna is very different from the other inhabitants of the Capitol; he does not use surgery to alter his features, wears simple black clothes, and leaves his hair its natural dark brown color, close cropped. His only concession to the Capitol's fashion style is a small amount of gold eyeliner that brings out the gold flecks in his eyes.</td>

The book gives no details; in the movie however, Crane is escorted by Peacekeepers and locked in an opulent room containing only an elegant bowl of fresh Nightlock berries for him to consume. In the second book, Katniss effectively both impresses and shocks the Gamemakers by using the paint from Peeta's effigy of Rue, a practice dummy strung from the rafters of the gymnasium with a hangman's noose, and the name "Seneca Crane" as a warning and epitaph.

They are residents of the Capitol and sport the usual radically altered appearances of Capitol residents, including orange corkscrew hair and purple lipstick (Flavius); pea-green skin (Octavia); and aqua-colored hair and a face etched with gold tattoos (Venia). At first it appears that they are very dull-witted and care only about their appearance. They prove themselves less shallow when they begin to cry while preparing Katniss for the Quarter Quell, from which they do not expect her to return. Katniss gleans valuable information from them by listening to them gossip about shortages of supplies, giving Katniss clues about which districts have rebelled. In <i>Mockingjay</i>, they are kidnapped and taken to District 13 to help with Katniss's styling, and they very quickly run afoul of District 13's draconian rules and end up cruelly punished for stealing bread. Katniss orders them set free and healed. Venia is said to have always been the strongest: for example, in <i>Catching Fire</i>, Venia is the only one to contain her emotions while working on Katniss's appearance, while Octavia and Flavius both needed to leave the room to control their emotions.</td>

Because of her inability to speak, Katniss initially does not know her name or anything about her. Katniss recognizes her from when she and Gale witnessed the girl's capture and the death of her friend, and Katniss later speculates that she is a runaway from the Capitol. In <i>Mockingjay</i>, Katniss learns that her name was Lavinia and that it was planned that she be tortured to death to traumatize Peeta. She was killed along with Darius. Katniss learns from Peeta that her torturers used too much electricity during the process and her heart stopped, accidentally granting her a quick and less painful death.</td>

However, he is shown to be honest, witty, and friendly, and Katniss learns to trust him. He serves as Katniss's bodyguard for part of <i>Mockingjay</i>, and is assigned to Squad 451 along with Katniss, Gale, and Finnick. He accidentally steps on a land mine on a Capitol street that the Holo did not detect. When his legs are blown off, the squad drags him into an apartment, where he gives Katniss his Holo and tells her to complete her "mission," to not trust "them" (who this is referring to is unclear), and to kill Peeta.

She dies after poisonous darts that shoot out of an incorrectly labelled pod, shoot her in the temple.

<td>From District 4, she competed in and won the 70th Hunger Games. She has sea green eyes and dark hair. She became mentally unstable after seeing the male tribute from her district decapitated. When an earthquake broke a dam, the arena was flooded. She won because, being from the fishing district, she was the best swimmer. Annie seems never to have fully recovered. She is chosen at the reaping for the Quarter Quell, but Mags volunteers to take her place, really trying to spare her. Her scream is used by the jabberjays (birds that are able to mimic whatever they hear) in the Quarter Quell to torment Finnick, who loves her. In <i>Mockingjay</i>, she and Finnick Odair marry, and she later gives birth to their son after his death.

Bonnie and Twill are on their way to District 13 and they are the first to tell Katniss that District 13 may exist. Katniss also begins to ponder the reality of District 13, when she realizes that they show the same footage of the burned-down justice building again and again, each time implying it is current footage.

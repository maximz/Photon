<p>The series is loosely divided into three arcs of four to five books each, chronicling the introduction and reveal of each "A". The series follows the lives of four teenage girls — whose names are mentioned above (nicknamed <i>the Pretty Little Liars</i> or simply <i>the Liars</i>) — whose clique falls apart after the disappearance of their best friend, Alison DiLaurentis. Three years after her disappearance, they begin receiving text messages from an anonymous source, "A," who threatens to expose their secrets; including long-hidden ones they thought only their close friend Alison knew. But shortly after the messages begin, Alison's body is discovered. The books progress with the four girls trying to figure out the identity of "A".</p>

<p>Although the series features an extensive cast of characters of varying significance, the novels focus predominantly on seven main characters:</p>
<p><b>Spencer Hastings</b></p>
<dl>
<dd>A competitive girl who strives for <a href="/wiki/Perfectionism_(psychology)" title="Perfectionism (psychology)">perfection</a> in everything she does. A high-strung over-achiever, Spencer is willing to do whatever it takes to win, often to the detriment of herself and others. She is often quick to jump to conclusions and suffers from <a href="/wiki/Intermittent_explosive_disorder" title="Intermittent explosive disorder">IED</a>. She also suffers from drug addiction that began to help her boost her grades in school. Spencer was a half-sister to Alison and Courtney DiLaurentis, her father having had an affair with Jessica DiLaurentis around the time of Spencer's conception. Spencer's parents later divorce when the affair comes to light. She attends a summer program at <a href="/wiki/University_of_Pennsylvania" title="University of Pennsylvania">Penn</a> to improve her GPA. Spencer has an ongoing feud with her older sister, Melissa, who is equally competitive. Throughout the book series, the two argue over the implications of their individual successes in life, such as becoming valedictorian and having award-winning essays. In Twisted, it is revealed that the siblings have made peace, and in the last few books they have a stronger bond. Spencer was accepted to Princeton and is going there in the fall. At the start of Crushed, she meets her boyfriend named Chase who helps her with her search for real Ali.</dd>
</dl>
<p><b>Hanna Marin</b></p>
<dl>
<dd>A popular girl who struggles with <a href="/wiki/Bulimia" title="Bulimia" class="mw-redirect">bulimia</a> and <a href="/wiki/Anorexia_nervosa" title="Anorexia nervosa">anorexia</a> due to insecurities about her appearance. While in seventh grade, Hanna was very overweight and developed complicated eating problems, including binge eating from stress often followed by a bulimic episode. Flighty and occasionally air-headed, Hanna often acts purely on impulse. In Alison's absence, she became best friends with Mona Vanderwaal, Ali's previous bullying target, and they transformed themselves into Rosewood's new "It" girls. Hanna's parents divorced when she was twelve, after her father had an affair. She lives with her mother and would rarely see her father, especially after he started dating an average-looking nurse named Isabel. Hanna dislikes her father's new wife, Isabel, and her daughter, Kate, with whom she forms a rivalry. Prior to <i>Twisted</i>, Hanna is involved in a car accident, which leaves another girl badly injured; she covers up her involvement with the help of the Liars. She is nominated for prom queen in Crushed along with Chassey Bladsoe, a former geek turned beautiful girl. It is also revealed in Crushed that she got accepted to FIT for college. Hanna dates Aria's brother, Mike.</dd>
</dl>
<p><b>Aria Montgomery</b></p>
<dl>
<dd>An artistic, bubbly, independent girl whose family moved back to Rosewood after her father took a three year <a href="/wiki/Sabbatical" title="Sabbatical">sabbatical</a> in Reykjavík, Iceland. Prior to Alison's disappearance, Aria became aware that her father was having an affair with Meredith, a student of his at the local college. Having promised her father to keep the affair a secret, Aria is kicked out of the house and goes to live with boyfriend at the time, Sean Ackard, after the first "A" reveals the affair to her mother. Her parents divorce and Aria's father marries Meredith who soon becomes pregnant. Aria often feels out of place in Rosewood and tends to be attracted to older, more worldly men, which frequently causes her conflicts. However, she dates Noel Kahn throughout most of the series. After a near-death experience, she is overcome with guilt and decides to confess to accidentally killing Tabitha (unaware she was not actually responsible for Tabitha's death). In Crushed it turns out she tried to steal a Van Gogh painting.</dd>
</dl>
<p><b>Emily Fields</b></p>
<dl>
<dd>Emily is a gay, dedicated swimmer. In "Flawless" she tells her parents she wants to quit swimming, but once she is made captain she changes her mind. She was in love with Alison, and kissed her once in seventh grade. A fact which she takes great pains <a href="/wiki/Closeted" title="Closeted">to hide</a>. She develops feelings for a new girl named Maya, resulting in a secret relationship, but she is then <a href="/wiki/Outed" title="Outed" class="mw-redirect">outed</a> by the first "A" when a picture of them kissing in the photo booth at the Kahn party is passed out at a swim meet. Although at first her parents make attempts to "de-gay" her, they eventually come to accept her and her sexuality. After she and Maya break up, Emily meets a guy named Isaac at a church event, and realizes that she's <a href="/wiki/Bisexual" title="Bisexual" class="mw-redirect">bisexual</a>. They start dating and Emily loses her <a href="/wiki/Virginity" title="Virginity">virginity</a> to Isaac, whom she later breaks up with. It was revealed in <i>Twisted</i> that Emily had gotten pregnant from her first time with Isaac and hid it from her family by staying with her sister Carolyn over the summer. She gave birth to a baby girl, Violet, and was going to give her to Gayle (her friend's extremely rich boss) for money but she changed her mind and gave the baby to the Bakers, a family she met through an adoption site. Emily's change in heart on who to give the baby to greatly anger Gayle, who later threatens both Emily and the baby. Even after the pregnancy, Emily receives an athletic scholarship to attend <a href="/wiki/University_of_North_Carolina" title="University of North Carolina">UNC</a>. In Wicked she and Maya seem to be enemies but in Heartless they make a brief truce. Maya has since not been mentioned. Emily later dates Jordan, a girl she meets on a cruise.</dd>
</dl>
<p><b>Alison DiLaurentis</b></p>
<dl>
<dd>An extremely popular, beautiful, and cruel girl. When she and her twin Courtney were younger, Alison was jealous of her more popular sister and forced Courtney to impersonate her, at the same time tormenting Courtney to the point where the two sisters got into a physical fight. When their parents called the doctors, Courtney panicked and revealed that Alison threatens her and wants her gone. Alison, who was acting very innocently all the time, claimed it was not true and stated that her sister has to go to the mental hospital. In the outcome, Alison successfully made everyone believe that Courtney was a paranoid schizophrenic. Her family then moved to Rosewood to avoid attention and changed their surname Day-DiLaurentis to DiLaurentis. In the beginning of sixth grade, Courtney managed to trick their mother Jessica into taking Ali to the mental hospital. Alison blamed the Liars for ruining her life and swore revenge. She was the second "A" and killed Courtney, Jenna and Ian. Later on she tries to kill the girls in her Poconos home but they manage to get out. Alison is left inside and it's unknown whether she died or not; later it is revealed she did indeed survive and was the third "A" torturing the girls along with her secret boyfriend, Nick. Nick was the murderer of Tabitha, Gayle, and Graham.</dd>
</dl>
<p><b>Courtney DiLaurentis</b></p>
<dl>
<dd>Courtney was the leader of the Liars under the assumed identity of Alison DiLaurentis. Her jealous twin sister, the "real" Alison DiLaurentis threatened her since childhood (despite their initial friendship), forcing Courtney to impersonate her, so she would seem crazy and therefore, be sent to a psych ward. Courtney tried to get the doctors to understand that she had been blackmailed by her sister, but they didn't believe her when Alison acted innocently and denied Courtney's confessions. In the outcome, Ali's master plan worked: Courtney was believed to be a paranoid schizophrenic. In the beginning of Alison's sixth grade, Courtney successfully tricked their mother Jessica into taking Ali to the mental hospital. In the aftermath, Courtney took her sister's place, pretending to be Alison, so that she won't be recognized as Courtney and therefore end up in a mental hospital; she became Ali. Even though Courtney was mean to everyone in school, she didn't want to be, because she only did it because she was pretending to be Alison. If she acted nicer to people, her family would notice the change, so Courtney always acted wrong despite her being good. She did tease the Liars but she secretly appreciated them. Later on, her sister Alison came back for her revenge and killed Courtney by pushing her into a hole that was originally made for a gazebo, accompanied by an unknown person who was later revealed to be Nick.

<td colspan="6">The story introduces an exclusive group of friends: Alison DiLaurentis, the popular yet manipulative queen bee, Aria Montgomery, an independent girl who is considered to be the oddball in Rosewood, Emily Fields, a swimmer who holds secret feelings for Alison, Hanna Marin, who strives to be thin and popular like Alison, and Spencer Hastings, an overachiever who is brave enough to stand up against Alison's manipulative ways. Alison mysteriously disappears during a sleepover with the girls in the summer before 8th grade.
<p>The story then jumps 3 years later, when the girls are living their own lives and don't speak to each other.</p>
<p>Aria returns to Rosewood from a 3 year trip to Iceland with her family and comes back much more sophisticated than before she left. She meets and makes out with a guy in a local bar who is revealed to be her English teacher, Ezra Fitz.</p>

<p>Hanna is the new popular girl in town alongside the former nerd, Mona Vanderwaal. However, she and Mona sometimes shoplift though both can clearly afford their steals. Hanna battles the urge to turn back to bulimia, and struggles to manage the stress of keeping her queen bee status.</p>
<p>Spencer continues to struggle in her long-standing rivalry with Melissa Hastings, her perfect older sister. Problems occur when she begins to feel attracted to Melissa's new boyfriend, Wren Kim.</p>
<p>Throughout the story, the liars get messages threatening to reveal their secrets of the present and past, including a terrifying incident the girls refer to as "The Jenna Thing".

However, they are shocked when the police find her corpse buried in the gazebo of her former house. The book ends with the liars receiving a text at Alison's funeral saying, "I'm still here, bitches. And I know everything. -A ". The girls have made up at this point.</p>

While at Hollis College, Aria takes an art class and befriends Jenna, who she suspects could be "A".</p>
<p>"A" reveals to Melissa (Spencer's sister) that Spencer stole her essay for the Golden Orchid competition, but the family keeps quiet to protect their reputation. Melissa and Spencer grow closer, and Spencer confesses that she kissed Ian, and that he and Alison were secretly dating. When fragments of her memory from the night Alison died are restored, Spencer is horrified when it dawns on her that she may have accidentally killed Alison.</p>
<p>Mona and Hanna's friendship is restored, and to celebrate Hanna's recovery, Mona and Spencer plan a party for her.

Hanna is thrilled that Spencer approves of Mona, and they consider letting her join their clique.</p>
<p>"A" tells Aria that Meredith has a secret job at Hooters, and she goes there with Mike, only to discover that "A" was lying. Darren Wilden and several other cops are there, and Aria is tempted to tell them about "A". When Mike realizes that something is troubling his sister, he urges her to tell Darren, and she eventually does. On the night of Hanna's party, Aria tells Jenna what happened the night she was blinded and apologizes for not stopping Alison, but Jenna reveals that she and Alison had planned it together to get rid of Toby. Aria asks Jenna about "A", but Jenna becomes scared and quickly leaves, hinting that she knows who "A" is.</p>
<p>Melissa confronts Spencer about seeing Ian behind her back, which Spencer denies, and when she leaves, Spencer and Mona discover another note from "A" and suspect that Melissa killed Alison because she was jealous of her relationship with Ian. They inform the others, and decide to turn Melissa in. Mona drives Spencer to the police station, and Aria tells Emily and Hanna the truth about The Jenna Thing. When Hanna says that one in four boys sexually abuse their sister, Emily tells her not to believe everything she hears, which causes Hanna's memory to return, and she is horrified when she remembers who "A" is: Mona.</p>
<p>Spencer is hesitant about turning in Melissa, but Mona comforts her and convinces her otherwise. Moments later, Spencer receives a text from Emily, telling her that Mona is "A". When she receives several more from the girls, who are worrying about what Mona will do, Mona realizes that they finally figured it out. While Aria, Emily and Hanna go to the police station to tell Darren that Mona is "A", Mona drives Spencer to Floating Man's Quarry, where she explains that she saw what happened on the night of The Jenna Thing, and when Maya moved in, she found Alison's diary, which contained the girls' secrets. Using the information to her advantage, she got a new phone and became "A" to get revenge on the girls for blinding Jenna. Spencer accuses Mona of killing Alison, but Mona says that it was Ian who killed her, as Alison had blackmailed him about their relationship.</p>
<p>Spencer secretly calls Darren, who overhears her conversation with Mona and learns of their location. Mona tells Spencer that she originally planned to frame her for Alison's murder, but recently grew to like her, and thus decided to frame Melissa to do Spencer a favor. She then offers Spencer her life in return that she becomes "A" with her, as they could pin the blame on someone else. Spencer refuses and Mona attacks her. They fight on the cliff's edge, and in the struggle, Spencer accidentally pushes Mona off the cliff to her death. Aria, Emily and Hanna arrive on the scene with Darren and police, and find Mona's body and an unconscious Spencer</p>

<p>Spencer's mom has begun to date Nicholas Pennythistle, the father of snobby Amelia and her brother Zach, in whom Spencer develops a romantic interest. Hanna gets trapped in an elevator from A. When they go out dancing, she kisses him, only to find out Zach is gay. When the Hastings and Pennythistles travel to New York together, Spencer and Zach drunkenly fall asleep in the same bed. During the night, Spencer had kicked off her clothes because she was hot, leaving her in her blouse and underwear. The next morning Mr. Pennythistle wakes them both up by entering the room. Their indecent clothing and close proximity leads Mr. Pennythistle to believe that they had slept together and acts violent. Spencer tells him that Zach didn't touch her and that he's gay, hoping to help, but Mr. Pennythistle becomes furious and sends Zach to military school. Zach and Spencer's friendship ends, Zach leaving Spencer with the words "Rot in hell, bitch".</p>
<p>The girls start to get messages from a new "A", and believe it's Ali and that she somehow survived the fall from the building. In the end of the book, the news turns on and a teenage girl's dead body was found floating in the water in Jamaica. They identify this girl as Tabitha Clark from New Jersey. The cops believe her death was a tragic accident - not a murder. The girls realize they killed an innocent girl.</p>

<td colspan="6">It is revealed that last summer while Spencer was taking AP courses at <a href="/wiki/University_of_Pennsylvania" title="University of Pennsylvania">Penn</a>, she began taking speed pills as a way to help with studying. After being arrested by the police for possession, she arranges for Hanna to help her frame her roommate, Kelsey, as a dealer, in order for Spencer to not face charges. After landing the role of Lady Macbeth in the school play, the stress and guilt begin to take their toll on Spencer, causing her to have frequent hallucinations in which she is haunted by Kelsey and Tabitha. She becomes paranoid and begins to believe Kelsey is "A" and is taking revenge on her for being framed.
<p>Emily accidentally meets Kelsey at a party and is instantly smitten with her. She and Kelsey grow close, much to Spencer's disapproval. After Emily is hurt by Spencer's remarks about her love for Alison, she angrily tells Kelsey that Spencer framed her for the drug possession. Depressed, Kelsey overdoses and attempts to throw herself into the quarry where Mona died, but Emily saves her and Kelsey is sent to the Preserve for treatment. While visiting Kelsey, the girls realize that Tabitha was also a patient at the Preserve and was the same age as Alison and Courtney.</p>
<p>Hanna's father asks her to help with the social media aspect of his campaigning. She meets a boy named Liam, who she falls for, despite knowing he is the son of her father's political opponent. They break up when she learns he has been seeing multiple other girls while dating her, and reconciles with Mike.</p>
<p>After Aria is dumped by Noel, she seeks out comfort in Ezra, in hopes of rekindling their romance. However, things are strained between them, and Aria eventually goes back into a relationship with Noel, after discovering Ezra and Klaudia being intimate.</p>
<p>The Liars attempt to circumvent "A's" threats by coming clean about their secrets, with varied success. Meanwhile, "A" becomes more violent, shoving Emily down a hill at Stockbridge trail. "A" sends Spencer an email of Tabitha on the beach with a head injury, indicating that "A" was the one who disposed of Tabitha's body. "A" taunts the Liars, stating they will never discover "A's" true identity. Kelsey cannot be A. Emily and Spencer have their biggest rivalry.</p>

While on a school-sponsored cruise in the Caribbean, the Liars uncover clues that suggest "A" is more than one person. They begin to suspect Naomi Zeigler of being "A", after she befriends Hanna (who is unaware that Madison is Naomi's cousin) and attempts to sabotage Spencer's new relationship. Aria becomes friends with a boy named Graham, only to discover he is Tabitha's ex-boyfriend, leading the Liars come to believe that Naomi and Graham are working together as "A".

<td colspan="6">Weeks before the annual, Rosewood Day Prom, the four girls are put under much stress. They break down and try being one step ahead of "A", and marking off who their suspects could be. In this novel it is revealed there are two people working as A. Spencer, Hanna, and Emily agree that the main suspect is Noel Kahn, Aria's boyfriend. Aria doesn't want to believe it but the facts tell her otherwise. He was on the trip to Jamaica, he went to Iceland. He was good friends with Ali (he loved her), and he visited her in the Preserve when she was there. He knew about the twins. He knew enough to make him look like A. Emily tries getting information of out of Ali's old friends, Iris, (who we met in ''<i>Heartless</i>). Iris tells Emily little tid bits of Ali, and at Prom Iris recognizes Noel and for sure he was Ali's secret boyfriend who visited her. Spencer finds an internet blogger, who blogs about Alison DiLaurentis theories. She meets him and actually ends up liking him, finding his name is Chase. He helps Spencer get information on Alison. Hanna, in an attempt to get information on a burned victim from the last book, Graham, starts volunteering at the Burn Clinic. There, Graham is still in acoma and right when he's about to wake up, he dies -all the information is kept hidden for good. Aria, worried and paranoid about what happened last summer, is trying to handle things with Noel being A, even though she doesn't want to believe it. At Prom, Noel admits to loving Ali, and Aria, furious, freaks out and asks Noel if Ali is still alive. He says He doesn't know, has he had contact with Ali since the Poconos explosion? Aria, in an attempt to run away, Noel gets her and pins her to the ground. Spencer, Hanna, and Emily arrive and Noel flees. The morning later, Hanna gets a text from A saying to go to the shed in the Rosewood Day back. She and the three other girls go, and just in case bring Cops and police and inside is a supposedly unconscious Noel tied up to a chair. It is not revealed if Noel is dead or alive. The girls get a text saying how they didn't find out anything, Noel wasn't A, and now they are back where they started. And of course, it was signed by A.</td>

<td colspan="6">
<p>Set between <i>Unbelievable</i> and <i>Wicked</i>, the book is told from the point-of-view of the second "A", Alison DiLaurentis, as she spies on the girls during their Christmas vacation. The novel is divided into a series of four short stories, with each one focusing on the exploits of a specific girl.</p>
<p>Spencer: Spencer and her family go to Nana Hastings mansion in Florida, and Spencer falls in love with a tennis player named Colin at the country club. Melissa seems to be helping Spencer win Colin's heart, but Colin ends up taking an interest in Melissa. During the trip, Spencer and her mother also run into Mrs DiLaurentis several times, and Spencer is confused by her mother's strange behavior around Mrs DiLaurentis. Spencer also decides to fight for Colin. After Colin dumps Melissa to go out with her, Spencer discovers he actually has a wife and child, and he is 33 years old. Spencer and Melissa decide to team up to get revenge on Colin by putting crushed Viagra in his Aminospa vitamin water right before his important tennis game. In the end, they all have a fun vacation, but Spencer worries that someone has been following her. Melissa and Spencer seem to briefly make up in this, hence the sisters' wary friendship in Wicked.</p>
<p>Emily: Emily is asked to go undercover as Santa Claus at the new mall, in order to catch 4 girls who work as elves there, who are suspected of vandalizing Christmas decorations around town, including Emily's mom's baby Jesus ceramic figure. The 4 girls, who call themselves the "Merry Elves", take a liking to Emily, and it is revealed that one of the girls, Cassie, was close with Alison. Emily accompanies the girls on their biggest prank yet, but Emily's mom uses her phone to track her, and the Merry Elves get caught. Eventually, the elves forgive Emily after she bails them out of jail. In the end, everyone realizes the true meaning of Christmas, but Emily can't shake off the weird feeling that someone is following her. It is revealed that A is blonde (she will later be revealed as Alison) as Emily sees a blonde figure run off.</p>
<p>Hanna: Hanna joins a boot camp after thinking she gained too much weight at a holiday party. She develops feelings for the instructor, Vince. She also develops a rival, Dinah, another girl who also likes Vince. After competing for Vince's affection, she and Dinah become friends after catching Kate making out with the mall's new Santa (prior to Emily), something which Hanna also photographs. After agreeing to stop chasing Vince, she celebrates by going out for drinks with Dinah, where Dinah admits she knew Alison. Hanna goes home drunk, causing her to oversleep. As she arrives at boot camp, she discovers Vince and Dinah kissing, revealing that Dinah only pretended to be friends with Hanna to have Hanna let down her guard. Hanna flees the scene, devastated, and is confronted by Kate, who, after receiving a tip-off, followed Hanna around, taking unflattering photos of her at boot camp, which she threatens to put on Facebook. Hanna counterattacks by showing Kate the pictures of her and Santa, causing Kate to back off. Hanna also improves her relationship with her father, who gives Hanna her grandmother's Cartier locket for Christmas. Hanna has a happy Christmas, despite the fact that she thinks someone other than Kate has been watching her every move. Some of what Dinah said may be true such as she knew Alison. But it is likely she made most of it up to get Hanna's trust.</p>
<p>Aria: Aria goes with her father and Mike to Bear Claw Resort, but leaves to go back home after finding out that Byron invited Meredith along as well. Upon arriving at home, she is surprised by her boyfriend from Iceland, Halbjorn. Halbjorn tells her that he's running from the Icelandic police who are after him because he protested against the demolition of a puffin sanctuary. Unfortunately, his travel visa only lasts for a week. Aria proposes the idea of marrying him, and the two head off to Atlantic City to get married. At the hotel, they attend a magic show involving two panthers, which angers Halbjorn, who cares a lot about the environment. After getting married the following day, which requires Aria to forge her mother's signature and lie about her age, they go to the place where the panthers are kept. After convincing Halbjorn not to release the panthers, they go back to the hotel. The next morning, Aria wakes up to find Halbjorn gone and his clothes missing as well. On the lobby's TV, Aria sees that Halbjorn released the panthers after all. Aria goes to the courthouse and confesses to forging Ella's signature, making the marriage null and void. Upon returning to Rosewood, she is joined by Mike and Byron, who know nothing about her marriage. As they watch TV, it shows that Halbjorn has been caught, and it also shows that he has done these things in the past, including trying to blow up a demolition office. Aria is satisfied with breaking up with him, but is paranoid about someone following her. In Wicked it is briefly stated that Aria and Meredith did converse about the baby.</p>
<p>The book ends with a sign-off from the new "A," (as always) who says that the Liars' lives are going to get a lot worse. All of which comes true...</p>

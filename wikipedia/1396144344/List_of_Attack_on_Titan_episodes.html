<td class="description" style="border-bottom:3px solid #800000" colspan="3">For over a century, humans have been living in settlements surrounded by gigantic walls, which prevent the Titans, giant humanoid creatures who eat humans, from entering. Young Eren Yeager wishes to see the outside world by joining the Recon Corps, as he likens living in the cities to livestock. Despite this, his foster sister Mikasa Ackerman and their mother Carla are against him in joining the Corps. Even after seeing the Recon Corps returning home with large casualties, Eren expresses his interest to join which impresses his father Dr. Grisha Yeager. After Eren and Mikasa save their friend Armin Arlert from bullies due to his views that the walls will not protect them forever, a Colossus Titan much taller than the walls suddenly appears and kicks down the gate into the District of Shiganshina, allowing smaller Titans to enter. As the city erupts into mass panic, Eren and Mikasa head to their home in a desperate attempt to save their mother who becomes trapped under their collapsed house by the debris falling from the wall. Despite Carla begging her children to leave her and save themselves, they refuse until City Guard Hannes arrives and takes the children away against Eren's wishes. As Hannes carries them away, Eren, picked up from behind the scenes, watches in horror as a Titan kills and eats their mother.&#160;</td>

<td class="description" style="border-bottom:3px solid #800000" colspan="3">Hannes apologizes to Eren for not saving his mother and admits he was afraid of the Titan and that both he and Mikasa are still weak children. The people of Shiganshina escape to the inner Wall Maria while the soldiers try to hold off the Titans. Fearing the Titans might advance further, the soldiers order to close the gate to Wall Maria despite Hannes' protest that there are still refugees outside. However, an Armored Titan rams into the gate, allowing the Titans to enter the lands of Wall Maria. As a result of the breach, the government orders all survivors from Wall Maria to evacuate into Wall Rosé. Some time later, Eren has a strange dream in which his grieving father forcefully gives him an injection and his key before being woken up by Mikasa. Eren grows disgusted with the people of Wall Rosé as the latter do not like sharing their food with the refugees. During the next year, as a food shortage becomes apparent, the government orders the refugees to work at the farms or fight to reclaim Wall Maria, which results in hundreds of thousands of deaths including Armin's grandfather. Eren vows revenge for what the Titans did and resolves to kill them by joining the Army along with Mikasa and Armin. A year later, Eren, Mikasa, Armin, and many young recruits begin their training.&#160;</td>

When Sasha Brause is caught eating a potato, she is punished to run around the camp. An exhausted Sasha is later taken back to bed by Ymir and Christa Lenz. Eren has a rivalry with Jean Kirstein, whom Eren finds cowardly since Jean wants to join the Military Police simply because their only job is to maintain civil order within the inner city walls. The recruits begin training on the 3-D Maneuver Gear by maintaining their balance while suspended in the air. Eren has trouble balancing his Gear, so he asks Reiner Braun and Bertholdt Huber for help. As they give Eren advice, both of them reveal that they came from a town that was not warned of the Titans' attack. Despite surviving, Reiner wants to go back to their hometown. Bertholdt, on the other hand, was traumatized by the Titans and wants to join the Military Police to avoid them. The next day, Eren tries the Maneuver Gear again and succeeds for a few seconds before falling once more. Much to everyone's surprise, Keith discovers that Eren's Gear was actually defective, and after equipping another recruit's working Gear, he proves to indeed have the aptitude to use it. The fact that Eren could maintain his balance even for a few seconds with a faulty Gear impresses Keith and the other recruits. Proud of the recruits who succeeded, Keith furthers their training with the Maneuver Gear.&#160;</td>

<td class="description" style="border-bottom:3px solid #800000" colspan="3">Five years since Wall Maria fell, the time for the recruits' graduation approaches. While training in <a href="/wiki/Hand-to-hand_combat" title="Hand-to-hand combat">hand-to-hand combat</a> with Reiner and Annie Leonhardt, Eren learns that many among his peers are just honing their abilities to earn a place in the Military Police and avoid confronting the Titans at all. Jean claims that confronting the Titans is pointless, as mankind has never won a battle against them. Despite this, Eren remains dead set on joining the Recon Corps. On the day of graduation, Christa, Sasha, Conny Springer, Marco Bott, Jean, Eren, Annie, Bertholdt, Reiner, and Mikasa become the top ten recruits of their class. Despite the fact that the top ten are allowed to join the Military Police, Eren joins the Recon Corps as he has always intended, with Armin and Mikasa to watch over him. Later Sasha, Conny, and some of the other recruits follow their example and join the Recon Corps as well, after being inspired by Eren's speech to have mankind freed of the Titans. They are assigned to the District of Trost, one of the cities near Wall Rosé, and are taken by surprise when the Colossus Titan appears before them and breaks through the gate, leaving the city unprotected. Once Eren regains his composure, he takes command and orders a counterattack, climbing back to the top of the wall to have his revenge against the Titan.&#160;</td>

Eren calms Armin and Jean who both start having nervous breakdowns due to the approaching Titans. Mikasa and Eren are assigned by the Army to different squads with Mikasa's squad assigned to help the evacuation while Eren and Armin's squad are to provide backup at the front lines. Despite Mikasa's protest of wanting to stay and protect Eren, he convinces her to do her duty after promising her he will not die. With the Titans now in the city, Eren recalls his lessons that to kill a Titan, they must strike the nape of their necks. As Eren's 34th squad attack, one by one his comrades are killed or eaten by the Titans with Eren himself losing his left leg. Armin, paralyzed with fear upon seeing his comrades' fate, is picked up by a Titan and almost swallowed. As Eren recalls his past of him and Armin wishing to see the world outside the walls, he manages to drag and toss Armin out of the Titan's mouth before he is completely swallowed. Armin tries to help Eren, but the Titan closes its jaw and eats Eren, much to his horror.&#160;</td>

Meanwhile, a greedy merchant tries to force his cargo into the city's exit gate and refuses to allow the refugees to go first. As the crowd grows impatient, a lone Titan starts approaching but is killed by Mikasa at the last second. When she realizes the merchant is the cause of the hold-up at the gate, she threatens him to move his cargo for the refugees. As she is thanked by a mother and daughter, Mikasa starts to reminiscence her past. In the year 844, a year before Wall Maria fell, Mikasa and her Asian mother were targeted by slave traders. The slavers kill her father and accidentally kill her mother. As Dr. Grisha and Eren discover Mikasa's parents' bodies at her home, Grisha orders Eren to return home. Instead, Eren tracks down the slavers to a nearby hut and kills two of them in an attempt to save Mikasa. However, the third slaver shows up and strangles Eren, who tells Mikasa to kill the man if she wants to live, which she does after obtaining resolve. Eventually, the children are found by Grisha and the police. As Mikasa laments that she has nowhere left to go home, she is invited by the Yeagers to live with them and Eren gives Mikasa his red scarf. Back in the present, Mikasa slays more Titans and goes to help the other squads evacuate.&#160;</td>

His anger over the Titans caused Eren to burst out of the Titan's stomach by transforming into a Titan himself and going on a rampage against them.

Kitz accuses Eren of being a Titan spy and demands to know what he is, but Eren has no idea since he has no memories of becoming a Titan or how his limbs grew back. Hoping to resolve the situation, Eren honestly answers he is human but a fearful Kitz orders the cannons to fire on them. As the three of them try to escape, Eren remembers his lost memories of his father giving him an injection, telling him to reclaim Wall Maria and go to their home's basement with his key.

Believing his comrades and squad's death could have been avoided if he had transformed in the first place, Eren fights the Female Titan in a long battle. The Female Titan defeats Eren by decapitating his head and swallowing Eren. Mikasa attempts to stop the Female Titan but to no avail. She is later joined by Levi who tells her to keep their distance, as the Female Titan is getting tired.&#160;</td>

Levi launches a successful high-speed attack that debilitates the Female Titan, but Mikasa leaves herself vulnerable when she tries to finish the Female Titan. She's saved by Levi, who breaks his leg in the process. They retreat with Eren's body, leaving the Female Titan badly wounded and slumped against a tree. As the Corps mourn, count their dead, and retrieve the bodies before returning home, Erwin orders that the fallen whose bodies were not retrieved be reported <a href="/wiki/Missing_in_action" title="Missing in action">MIA</a>. However, a Corps member, Dieter, against direct orders from Erwin, retrieves his dead friend Ivan's body, which draws the attention of two Titans to the retreating Corps. Mikasa kills one of the Titans to save Dieter, who loses both Ivan's body and another friend to a Titan. In order to outrun the remaining Titan, Levi reluctantly orders some of the bodies to be disposed in order to lighten the wagon's load, including Petra's body. Later, Eren wakes up from a dream of his past to find himself and the Corps back at town, safely behind the wall. He becomes angry upon hearing the townspeople berate the Corps' ineptitude, until he sees a boy who admires their bravery, which sends him into tears. All the while, a shocked Levi is questioned by Petra's father over his daughter's whereabouts, who reveals that Petra planned on devoting her life to Levi. The townspeople also become enraged and upset at Erwin over the failure of the mission and the casualties that were sustained. As a result of the failed expedition, Erwin and his subordinates are summoned to the capital, where it will be decided that Eren will be handed over.&#160;</td>

<td class="description" style="border-bottom:3px solid #800000" colspan="3">Annie has a dream of being trained by her father before waking up. In the Stohess District of Wall Sina, the Military Police are ordered to escort the Recon Corps convoy once they enter the capital. The Military Police are shown to be lazy and corrupt which one of Annie's colleagues, Hitch, reveals she joined the police for that reason. Another colleague, Marlow, is disgusted, revealing he joined the police so he could reform it to become a better organization which Annie respects since he reminds her of Eren. After the convoy has entered Stohess, Annie is secretly called by Armin in the alleyways. Armin asks for her help as he is helping Eren escape the capital as the one riding in the convoy is actually Jean in disguise. She refuses at first but after Armin begs again, believing she is a good person, she finally agrees. Together with Annie, Mikasa, and Eren, Armin leads them to an underground tunnel. However, Annie refuses to enter as she has noticed Armin behaving strangely and hidden Recon Corps members watching her. Armin finally reveals his suspicion that Annie is the Female Titan since the Maneuver Gear she had after Sawney and Bean were killed is Marco's and the Female Titan did not kill him during the last expedition. Eren and Armin beg Annie to prove them wrong by following them, but knowing her identity is exposed, Annie laughs sadly and tries to transform. Despite the Corps' attempts to stop her, she succeeds in transforming using the spike in her ring.&#160;</td>

Eren tries to transform but is unable to which Mikasa suspects his feelings for Annie are preventing him.

Meanwhile, Commander Nile Dawk of the Military Police demands an explanation from Erwin on what is happening as his men hold him at gunpoint. As Mikasa and the rest of the Recon Corps distract and try to capture the Female Titan, Armin and Jean attempt to free Eren from the rubble. Armin tells Eren he has to fight Annie as anyone who refuses to sacrifice anything can never change anything. As Eren thinks about what Armin said, he remembers his hatred for the Titan who killed his mother. Eren finally transforms into the Rogue Titan and charges at the Female Titan in rage.&#160;</td>

Meanwhile, Erwin tells Nile he will accept responsibility for the damage his plan has caused, for which Nile has Erwin arrested while the Military Police help evacuate the civilians. After exchanging several blows, a berserk Eren completely overpowers Annie who attempts to escape by climbing up Wall Sina. However, Mikasa cuts off Annie's Titan fingers, sending her falling. As Annie falls, she remembers her father asking for forgiveness, telling her to hate the world and ask her to promise him she will come back home. When it appears Eren is about to eat Annie, he stops once he sees her crying, and her body starts encasing itself in crystal. As Eren recuperates, he admits to Mikasa, Jean, and Armin that he allowed Annie to get herself encased. As Jean and Armin wonder if sacrificing their humanity to defeat the Titans is worth the price, Erwin attends a government inquiry. Erwin reveals he kept his plans secret to prevent leaks. He further explains that despite the deaths and casualties of his plan and how they cannot get any information from Annie now that she is encased, she is proof there are humans that can turn into Titans living within the walls and he plans to find and use them to launch a counterattack against the Titans. In the end, Erwin's name is cleared, Eren stays with the Recon Corps, Annie is put under the Corps' custody and the rest of the 104th Top Trainees go on their different missions. In the epilogue, a piece of Wall Sina falls, revealing the face of a Titan within the wall.&#160;</td>

Curiously, as Hange gets the Titan to chase after her, it suddenly retreats to the forest. Hange follows it to the center of the forest, where she finds it banging its head against a certain tree. The Titan turns hostile when Hange gets close to it, but Levi and the others arrive and kill it, much to Hange's dismay. Upon inspecting the scene, they discovered the decapitated body of Ilse Langnar, a soldier from the 34th Recon Corps division, resting inside of the tree, finding a notebook belonging to her lying on the ground. The notebook detailed Ilse's records, as she escaped on foot after her squad was killed by Titans. She eventually became cornered by a Titan, but instead of killing her right away, it starts speaking to her in human language, calling her "Ymir". Ilse attempted to communicate with the Titan, but it inevitably became hostile again and bit off her head, curiously choosing not to devour her body but instead rest it inside the tree. Having read through all of Ilse's notes, Hange uses the notebook as leverage to convince Erwin to approve of operations to capture Titans alive and study them, before returning Ilse's belongings to her family.&#160;</td>

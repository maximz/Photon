Set in Miami, "Austin & Ally" is a multi-camera comedy about the relationship between two very different musicians: extroverted singer and instrumentalist Austin Moon, who is fun-loving and outgoing; and introverted and awkward songwriter Ally Dawson, who can sing but has an extreme case of stage fright. 
Austin becomes famous after he secretly records one of Ally's songs with the help of his best friend Dez, and posts it on the internet. However, he did so without Ally's knowledge, and once Ally, convinced by her best friend Trish, takes credit for her song, Austin convinces her to become partners. The two agree to work together, and become close friends, while struggling to keep Austin's newfound fame and profit from it, with the help of Trish and Dez. They face adventures while in Austin's music career. At the end of the 1st season, Austin gets signed to Jimmy Starr's record label.
In Season 2, Austin's music career begins to take off, and Ally's stage fright becomes less horrible. Trish start's dating a guy named Trent, but breaks up with him after the gang finds out he is a cheater. There is also a 10 year old reporter from Cheetah beat named Megan who starts to follow the gang around. In, Ferris Wheels & Funky Breath, Austin meets a girl named Kira, Jimmy Starr's daughter, who has terrible breath. In Girlfriends & Girl Friends, Kira's breath becomes better, and Austin and Kira begin to date. When Austin & Ally plan the date, Ally begins to like Austin. In, Campers & Complications, Austin begins to like Ally too, and thinks she likes her friend Elliot.

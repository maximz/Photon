Several explosions have been recorded in Earth's atmosphere that are likely caused by the air burst that results from a large meteor burning up as it hits the atmosphere. The best known, and most spectacular was the 1908 Tunguska event. Witnesses describe most of these explosions as preceded by the appearance of a meteor-like object.

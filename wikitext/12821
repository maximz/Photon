U (named "u" , plural "ues", forms/script: ) is the twenty-first letter in the ISO basic Latin alphabet and a vowel in the English alphabet. Symbol 'U' is the chemical symbol for uranium.
History.
The letter U ultimately comes from the Semitic letter "Waw" by way of the letter Y. See the letter Y for details.
During the late Middle Ages, two forms of 'v' developed, which were both used for its ancestor 'u' and modern 'v'. The pointed form 'v' was written at the beginning of a word, while a rounded form 'u' was used in the middle or end, regardless of sound. So whereas 'valor' and 'excuse' appeared as in modern printing, 'have' and 'upon' were printed 'haue' and 'vpon'. The first distinction between the letters 'u' and 'v' is recorded in a Gothic alphabet from 1386, where 'v' preceded 'u'. By the mid-16th century, the 'v' form was used to represent the consonant and 'u' the vowel sound, giving us the modern letter 'u'. Capital 'U' was not accepted as a distinct letter until many years later.

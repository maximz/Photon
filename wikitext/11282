UFC 158: St-Pierre vs. Diaz is an upcoming mixed martial arts event to be held by the Ultimate Fighting Championship on March 16, 2013 at the Bell Centre in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. The tagline for the event is "Bad Blood Runs Deep".
Background.
The main event is the culmination of the rivalry between Georges St-Pierre and Nick Diaz, with the latter having been vocal in wanting to fight the current champion for nearly two years. However, what at one time was perceived by many to potentially be one of MMA's biggest super-fights, the bout has now been viewed by many MMA observers as simply a tune-up on the way to a bigger fight for St-Pierre after Diaz's loss in his last bout to Carlos Condit at UFC 143.
A rematch between Alessio Sakara and Patrick Côté, from UFC 154, was briefly linked to this event. However, Sakara was forced out of the bout due to renal stress.
Sean Pierson was expected to face Rick Story at the event. However, Pierson pulled out of the bout citing an injury and was replaced by Quinn Mulhern.
Rory MacDonald was originally scheduled to face Carlos Condit in a rematch. However, on February 18, it was announced that MacDonald pulled out of the bout citing a neck injury. Condit will now face Johny Hendricks who was pulled from his bout with Jake Ellenberger. Ellenberger will now face returning veteran Nate Marquardt.
Mitch Gagnon was expected to face Issei Tamura at the event. However, Gagnon was forced out of the bout with an injury and was replaced by T.J. Dillashaw.

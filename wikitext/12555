Production.
The series was renewed for an eighth season on March 29, 2012. Executive producer Stephen Nathan commented that season eight will include storylines that were originally intended for the previous season, but due to the shortened episode count, they were not able to write them in. Twenty-two episodes will be produced during season eight, with the extra four episodes that were ordered by Fox for the previous season to be incorporated into season eight, making a total of 26 episodes. Series creator Hart Hanson believes the show could last another two seasons (seasons 9 and 10), saying "we're very, very confident in having at least a season 9, and I can see as far as season 10 before my eyes get misty."

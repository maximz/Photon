As of 2010 he stars as Daryl Dixon in the AMC television series "The Walking Dead".

The Walking Dead comic creator, Robert Kirkman has stated he feels "absolutely blessed has honored the show with his presence, and the way he has come in and taken over that role and defined Daryl Dixon. A lot of Norman's portrayal of the character in the first season inspired all the writers to do what we did with him in the second season. We love writing him and end up doing cool stuff with him."

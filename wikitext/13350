In Greek mythology, the Argo (in Greek: Ἀργώ, meaning 'swift') was the ship on which Jason and the Argonauts sailed from Iolcos to retrieve the Golden Fleece. It was named after its builder, Argus.
Legend.
The "Argo" was built by the shipwright Argus, and its crew were specially protected by the goddess Hera. The best source for the myth is the "Argonautica" by Apollonius Rhodius. According to a variety of sources of the legend, the "Argo" was said to have been planned or constructed with the help of Athena. According to other legends it contained in its prow a magical piece of timber from the sacred forest of Dodona, which could speak and render prophecies. After the successful journey, the "Argo" was consecrated to Poseidon in the Isthmus of Corinth. It was then translated into the sky and turned into the constellation of Argo Navis.
Several authors of antiquity (Apollonius Rhodius, Pliny, Philostephanus) discussed the hypothetical shape of the ship. Generally it was imagined like a Greek warship, a galley, and authors hypothesized that it was the first ship of this type that had gone out on a high-sea voyage.
Replica.
A replica of a Greek penteconter was completed in 2008, which was named Argo. This vessel, with a 50-oar crew made up from all 27 European Union member countries, sailed from Jason's hometown of Volos to Venice, stopping at 23 cities "en route".

José Antonio Domínguez Banderas (born 10 August 1960), better known as Antonio Banderas, is a Spanish film actor, film director, film producer and singer. He began his acting career with a series of films by director Pedro Almodóvar and then appeared in high-profile Hollywood movies, especially in the 1990s, including "Assassins", "Evita", "", "Philadelphia", "Desperado", "The Mask of Zorro" and "Spy Kids". Banderas is also a voice artist, portraying the voice of "Puss in Boots" in the "Shrek" sequels and "Puss in Boots" as well as the bee in the Nasonex commercials.
Early life.
Banderas was born José Antonio Domínguez Banderas in Málaga, Andalucía, Spain, on 10 August 1960, to Ana Banderas, a Greek school teacher, and José Domínguez, a police officer in the Guardia Civil. He has a younger brother, Javier. Although the family name is Domínguez, he took his mother's last name as his stage name. As a child, he wanted to become a professional soccer player until a broken foot sidelined his dreams at the age of fourteen. He went on to enroll in some drama classes, eventually joining a theater that toured all over Spain. His work in the theater, and his performances on the streets, eventually landed him a spot with the National Theatre of Spain.
Career.
Early work, 1982–90.
Banderas began working in small theatres during Spain's post-dictatorial cultural movement known as the 'Movida'. While performing with the theatre, Banderas caught the attention of Spanish director Pedro Almodóvar, who cast the young actor in his 1982 movie debut "Labyrinth of Passion". 5 years later, he went on to appear in the director's "Law of Desire", making headlines with his performance as a gay man, which required him to engage in his first male-to-male onscreen kiss. After Banderas appeared in Almodóvar's 1986 "Matador", the director cast him in his internationally acclaimed 1988 film, "Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown". The recognition Banderas gained for his role increased two years later when he starred in Almodóvar's controversial "Tie Me Up! Tie Me Down!" as a mental patient who kidnaps a porn star (Victoria Abril) and keeps her tied up until she returns his love. It was his breakthrough role in "Tie Me Up! Tie Me Down!", that helped spur him on to Hollywood. Banderas' having become a regular feature of Almodóvar's movies all throughout the 1980s, Almodóvar is credited for helping launch Banderas's international career. 
Breakthrough, 1991–94.
In 1991, Madonna introduced Banderas to Hollywood in "". In the movie, Madonna says that she wants to seduce Banderas, even though she knows he is married.
The following year, still speaking minimal English, he began acting in U.S. films. Despite having to learn all his lines phonetically, Banderas still managed to turn in a critically praised performance as a struggling musician in his first American drama film, "The Mambo Kings" (1992).
Banderas then broke through to mainstream American audiences in the film, "Philadelphia" (1993), as the gay lover of AIDS-afflicted lawyer Andrew Beckett (Tom Hanks). The film's success earned Banderas wide recognition, and the following year was given a role in Neil Jordan's high-profile of Anne Rice's "Interview with the Vampire", which allowed him to share the screen with Tom Cruise and Brad Pitt.
Worldwide recognition, 1995–present.

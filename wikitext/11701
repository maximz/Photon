He remained restrained after Chelsea were knocked out of the Champions League by Barcelona and even made a point of swapping shirts with Andrés Iniesta."
Lampard's 20th goal of the season was the winning goal in the FA Cup Final against Everton, with a left-foot shot from long-range.

Lampard was pivotal in the semi-finals of the 2011–12 UEFA Champions League against the heavily favoured defending champions Barcelona. Bookmakers had Barcelona on the shortest odds to win a second consecutive Champions League title, and various commentators opined that Chelsea would have to produce their best two games of the season – and hope that Barca played their worst two – in order to upset the Catalan giants. In the first leg at Stamford Bridge, Lampard stripped Lionel Messi off the ball then played a cross-field pass to Ramires who setup Drogba for the only goal of the game giving Chelsea a 1–0 advantage. In the second leg at Camp Nou, Lampard assumed the captaincy after Terry was sent off early in the game.

In mid-February 2009, it was reported that Lampard and Rivas had split in November 2008 after seven years together, with Rivas taking between £1 million and £12.5 million in settlement fees from Lampard's estimated £32 million net worth.
Since October 2009, Lampard has been in a relationship with Christine Bleakley. On 15 June 2011, Lampard's engagement to Christine Bleakley was announced by his agent.
On 24 April 2009, Lampard was involved in a radio confrontation with James O'Brien on the London radio station LBC 97.3. Newspapers had reported that following Lampard's split from Rivas their children were living with her in a small flat while Lampard had converted their family home into a bachelor pad. Lampard phoned in, objecting to criticism, and asserting that he had fought "tooth and nail" to keep his family together.
In February 2013, Lampard signed a deal with publishers Little Brown to write his own series of children's books called "Frankie's Magic Football", aimed at youngsters aged five and over. The publishing deal was handled by Neil Blair and Zoe King, who also represent Harry Potter author J.K. Rowling.

Robert Keith Horry Jr. (; born August 25, 1970) is a retired American basketball player and current sports commentator. He played 16 seasons in the National Basketball Association (NBA), winning seven championships, the most of any player not to have played on the 1960s Boston Celtics. He is one of only two players (the other is John Salley) to have won NBA championships with three different teams: two with the Houston Rockets, three with the Los Angeles Lakers and two with the San Antonio Spurs. He earned the nickname "Big Shot Rob" because of his clutch shooting in important games, and he is widely considered to be one of the greatest clutch performers in the history of the NBA. Horry now works as a commentator on Time Warner Cable SportsNet.
Early life, high school and college basketball.
Born in Harford County, Maryland to Staff Sergeant Robert Horry Sr. and mother Leila, Horry grew up in Andalusia, Alabama. Although Horry's father moved to South Carolina after divorcing his mother soon after his birth, the father and son would meet weekly when Robert Sr. was stationed at Fort Benning, Georgia. 
As a senior at Andalusia High School, Horry won the Naismith Alabama High School Player of the Year award. He attended the University of Alabama on a basketball scholarship, where he was a teammate of fellow future NBA player Latrell Sprewell.
At Alabama, Horry started 108 of the 133 games he played in and helped the Tide win three SEC tournament titles and two berths in the NCAA's Sweet 16 round. Alabama compiled a 98-36 record during his four seasons, with Horry establishing a school record for career blocked shots (282). He was selected to the All-Southeastern Conference, the SEC All-Defensive and the SEC All-Academic teams.
NBA career.
Houston Rockets (1992-1996).
Horry was selected 11th overall in the 1992 NBA Draft by the Houston Rockets as a small forward. He spent his first four seasons with the Rockets, helping them win the NBA Championship in 1994 and 1995. While in the Finals, Horry set an individual NBA Finals record with seven steals in a game and also hit five 3-pointers in a quarter. During his years with the Rockets, Horry wore number 25.
In February 1994, he and Matt Bullard were traded to the Detroit Pistons for Sean Elliott, but Elliott failed a physical because of kidney problems, and the trade was rescinded. Horry said that the trade falling through probably saved his career. Horry went on to be a key member of the Rockets' title teams and began to lay the foundations for his "Big Shot Rob" reputation with a game-winning jumper in the final seconds of Game 1 of the 1995 Western Conference Finals vs. the San Antonio Spurs and adding a crucial basket in a 106-103 win in Game 3 of the NBA Finals against the Orlando Magic. Following the victory at the 1995 NBA Finals, Horry and the Rockets would win their second NBA Championship. Horry said that out of his 7 championship victories, this was the one he was the most proud of because the Rockets were the 6th seed in the Western Conference.
Phoenix Suns (1996-1997).
On August 19, 1996, Horry was traded to the Phoenix Suns along with Sam Cassell, Chucky Brown and Mark Bryant for former NBA Most Valuable Player Charles Barkley. Horry had been criticized in Houston for not taking enough shots and felt that was what prompted the Rockets to trade him. After joining the Suns, Horry had an on-court altercation with coach Danny Ainge, during which Horry threw a towel at Ainge.
Los Angeles Lakers (1997-2003).
The incident with Ainge led to Horry's suspension and trade to the Los Angeles Lakers on January 10, 1997, for Cedric Ceballos. Because the Lakers had retired jersey number 25 to honor Gail Goodrich, Horry wore the number 5 instead. Horry was a member of the Lakers when they won three consecutive NBA championships (2000, 2001, and 2002). During the 2000 and 2001 seasons, Horry played behind A.C. Green and Horace Grant respectively, but frequently garnered more minutes off the bench than the starters, especially during the playoffs. In the 2002 playoffs, Horry averaged 37.0 minutes per game. Horry's increasing minutes in the playoffs can be attributed to his knack for making clutch plays, including some key 3 pointers late in games, thus strengthening his reputation as a big game player and further justifying the "Big Shot Rob" nickname.
Over the Lakers' three-year run, Horry made a game-clinching three-pointer in at least one game in four straight playoff series (starting with the 2001 NBA Finals), but perhaps none more important than in Game 4 of the 2002 Western Conference Finals against the Sacramento Kings. Trailing two games to one in the series and facing Game 5 in Sacramento, the Lakers were down by as many as 24 points in the first half. Eventually, the Lakers cut the lead to 99–97 with 11.8 seconds to play. On the final possession, after Kobe and Shaq missed consecutive layups, Sacramento center Vlade Divac knocked the ball away from the basket in an attempt to run out the clock. However, the ball bounced right to Horry, who hit a 3-pointer as time expired to win Game 4 100–99. A day later, Magic Johnson was quoted as calling Horry, "one of the 10 best clutch players in league history". The Lakers would eventually win the series in 7 games. The Lakers went on to sweep the New Jersey Nets 4–0 in the NBA Finals.
A situation similar to Game 4 happened on March 5, 2003 in a game against the Indiana Pacers when, while the game was tied at 95, Pacers center Jermaine O'Neal swatted the inside pass for Shaquille O'Neal right into the hands of a wide open Horry, who calmly hit the game-winning shot.
In the 2003 playoffs, the Lakers were attempting to win their fourth straight NBA championship. But in Game 5 in the Western Conference Semifinals against the Spurs, Horry's chance for another game-winner rattled in and out with 5 seconds left, wiping out the Lakers' rally from a 25-point deficit. Horry went 0-18 on 3-pointers in the series and the Lakers were eliminated in six games.
San Antonio Spurs (2003-2008).
Following the 2002–03 season, Horry became a free agent. Citing concerns over family, all of whom live in Houston, Horry signed with the San Antonio Spurs. During the 2002–2003 season, the Lakers had leaned heavily on Horry. With the Spurs, coach Gregg Popovich cut Horry's minutes significantly, resulting in renewed success.
During the 2004–05 season, the Spurs reached and went on to win the 2005 NBA Finals. Horry played a significant part for the team's success, going 38 of 85 behind the 3-point line in the 2005 playoffs. In Game 5 of the 2005 NBA Finals against the Detroit Pistons, Horry provided more heroics in the fourth quarter to boost San Antonio to a win and 3–2 series lead over Detroit. After only scoring three points in the first three quarters, he scored 21 of the Spurs' points in the 4th quarter and overtime. The Spurs went on to win Game 5 96–95 after Horry hit a game-winning three-point shot in the final seconds. His late game heroics at age 34 were so astounding that prominent ESPN columnist Bill Simmons said of the performance, "Horry's Game 5 ranks alongside MJ's Game 6 in 1998, Worthy's Game 7 in 1988, Frazier's Game 7 in 1970 and every other clutch Finals performance over the years". After winning the series in seven games, the Spurs won their third NBA Championship in seven seasons and Horry received his sixth championship ring. Horry continued to wear number 5 after joining the Spurs. He began wearing the number 25 again after the 2004-05 season.
During the 2007 NBA playoffs, Horry hip-checked Phoenix Suns point guard Steve Nash which resulted in a flagrant foul on Horry. During the ensuing commotion, Raja Bell was assessed a technical foul for charging at Horry. Horry was ejected from the game and suspended for Games 5 and 6. Amar'e Stoudemire and Boris Diaw who left the vicinity of the bench, were issued a suspension for Game 5. The Spurs won the two ensuing games and subsequently moved on to the 2007 NBA Championship, where they swept the Cleveland Cavaliers winning their fourth NBA title and Horry's seventh individual ring.
Late in his career, Horry was criticized for his hard foul against Steve Nash of the Phoenix Suns in 2007 and his foul on David West of the New Orleans Hornets in 2008, prompting some unhappy fans to call him "Cheap Shot Rob".
After the 2007–08 season, Robert Horry became a free agent but went unsigned, marking his last professional season.
Records and honors.
Horry collected his seventh championship as a member of the Spurs in 2007. He is one of only nine players to have won seven or more championships in the NBA, and the only one who did not play on the 1960s Celtics. Robert Horry is one of only three players to win consecutive NBA Championships with two different teams. In 2005, he joined John Salley as the only players to win NBA rings with three different teams. He is the all-time leader in playoff games played with 244, having surpassed Kareem Abdul-Jabbar during the 2008 playoffs.
Horry holds the record for three-pointers all-time in the NBA Finals with 53, having eclipsed Michael Jordan's previous record of 42. He set the NBA Playoffs record for most three-point field goals made in a game without a miss (7) against the Utah Jazz in Game 2 of the 1997 Western Conference Semifinals. Horry has regular season career averages of 7.2 points, 4.9 rebounds and 2.2 assists per game.
Horry and Steve Kerr, another famous reserve player and clutch shooter, alternated NBA Championships for a decade, and combined to win 12 championships over a 14-year period. Either Kerr or Horry was on the roster of an NBA Finals team from the 1993-94 season through the 2002-03 season, with every one resulting in a victory. Horry's teams were victorious in the NBA Finals in 1994, 1995, 2000, 2001, 2002, 2005 and 2007, while Kerr's teams were winners in the NBA Finals in 1996, 1997, 1998, 1999 and 2003. Each won three titles playing for Phil Jackson-coached teams and two with the San Antonio Spurs.
Horry was the first player ever to accumulate 100 steals, 100 blocked shots and 100 threes in one season. In 2010, he was inducted into the Alabama Sports Hall of Fame.
Notable playoff clutch shots.
Horry hit a jumper with 6.5 seconds left to give Houston a 94-93 win over San Antonio at the Alamodome.
With the Rockets up 101-100 with 20 seconds left and the shot clock winding down, Hakeem Olajuwon kicked it out to Horry, who hit a 3 over Orlando's Horace Grant to give Houston a 104-100 lead with 14.1 seconds left. It led them to a 106-103 win and a 3-0 series lead. Houston won Game 4 to complete the sweep and win back-to-back NBA titles.
Horry hit all 7 of his 3-point shots. It wasn't enough as the Lakers lost 103-101 and the series 4-1.
With the series tied at 1, the Sixers were down 89-88 with under a minute and with Shaquille O'Neal on the bench having fouled out for the Lakers. Brian Shaw found Horry in the corner. He hit the 3 with 47.1 seconds left to give the Lakers a 4-point lead. Horry, who had been a 44% free throw shooter in the playoffs to that point, also made 4 free throws in the final minute to seal the victory. The Sixers never recovered.
Down 91-89 with 10.2 seconds left, Kobe Bryant drove on Ruben Patterson and kicked it out to Horry, who hit the game-winning 3 with 2.1 seconds left.
The Kings led 99-97 with 11.8 seconds left. After Kobe Bryant attempted a game-tying shot and missed, Shaquille O'Neal attempted a putback. When that missed, Vlade Divac knocked the ball away to try to run out the clock. However, it came right to Horry, who hit the game-winning 3 at the buzzer to give the Lakers a 100-99 victory and tie the series at 2 going back to Sacramento for Game 5. L.A. eventually beat the Kings in 7 and went on to win their 3rd straight NBA championship against the New Jersey Nets.
Horry inbounded to Manu Ginóbili, who was cornered by two Pistons defenders. Ginóbili passed it back to Horry on the left wing, who then hit a 3 with 5.9 seconds left to give the Spurs a 96-95 victory and a 3-2 series lead heading into Game 6. Horry scored 21 points combined, in the fourth quarter and OT to carry the struggling Spurs.
The Spurs led by one with 30 seconds left when Horry hit a game-securing 3 from the right corner over the outstretched hands of Marcus Camby, handing the Spurs their fifth straight playoff victory in Denver.
Personal life.
Horry lives with his family in Houston. His first child, and daughter, Ashlyn, was diagnosed with a rare genetic disorder called 1p36 deletion syndrome, an affliction that develops when part of the first chromosome is missing. She died on June 14, 2011, at the age of 17. He also has a son, Cameron.

In 1977, Fisher starred as Princess Leia Organa in George Lucas's science fiction film "Star Wars" (later retitled ') opposite Mark Hamill and Harrison Ford, a part she sarcastically claims to have obtained by sleeping "with some nerd." At the time, she believed the script for "Star Wars" was fantastic, but did not expect many people to agree with her, and though her fellow actors were not close at the time, they bonded after the commercial success of the film. The huge success of ' made her internationally famous and the character of Princess Leia became a merchandising triumph; there were small plastic action figures of the Princess in toy stores across the United States. She appeared as Princess Leia in the 1978 made-for-TV film, "The Star Wars Holiday Special," and showed off her singing talent in the last scene.
In May 1978, she appeared alongside John Ritter in the ABC-TV film "Leave Yesterday Behind," as a horse trainer who helps Ritter's character after an accident leaves him a paraplegic. At this time, Fisher appeared with Laurence Olivier and Joanne Woodward in the anthology series "Laurence Olivier Presents" in a television version of the William Inge play "Come Back, Little Sheba."

That year, she reprised her role as Leia Organa in "". She made her third and final appearance as Leia Organa in "," for which she became a sex symbol due to her appearance wearing a golden metal bikini (the outfit Leia was forced to wear as a slave girl of Jabba the Hutt), which almost immediately rose to pop culture icon status.

In 1987, Fisher published her first novel, "Postcards from the Edge."

It became a bestseller, and she received the Los Angeles Pen Award for Best First Novel. Also during 1987, she was in the Australian film "The Time Guardian."

2000s.
In the film "Scream 3" (2000), Fisher played an actress mistaken for Carrie Fisher. Director Wes Craven's commentary on the "Scream 3" DVD suggests that the sequence had, in fact, been written by Fisher herself.

Besides acting and writing original works, Fisher was one of the top script doctors in Hollywood, working on the screenplays of other writers. She did uncredited polishes on movies starting with "The Wedding Singer" and "Sister Act," and was hired by the creator of "Star Wars," George Lucas, to polish scripts for his 1992 TV series "The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles." Her expertise in this area was the reason she was chosen as one of the interviewers for the screenwriting documentary "Dreams on Spec" in 2007. However, during an interview in 2004, she said that she no longer did much script doctoring.
Fisher also voices Peter Griffin's boss, Angela, on the animated sitcom "Family Guy" and appeared in a book of photographs titled "Hollywood Moms" (2001) for which she wrote the introduction.

Personal life.
Fisher was briefly engaged to the actor and comedian Dan Aykroyd, who proposed on the set of their film "The Blues Brothers" in 1980. She has stated: "We had rings, we got blood tests, the whole shot. But then I got back together with Paul Simon."
Fisher dated musician Paul Simon from 1977 until 1983 and was then married to him from August 1983 to July 1984. They dated again for a time after their divorce. During their marriage, she appeared in Simon's music video for the song "Rene and Georgette Magritte with Their Dog after the War".
Subsequently, she had a relationship with Creative Artists Agency principal and casting agent Bryan Lourd. They had one child together, Billie Catherine Lourd (born July 17, 1992). Eddie Fisher states in his autobiography ("Been There Done That") his granddaughter's name is Catherine Fisher Lourd and her nickname is "Billy". The couple's relationship ended when Lourd left to be in a homosexual relationship. Though Fisher has described Lourd as her second husband in interviews, according to a 2004 profile of the actress and writer, she and Lourd were never legally married.
Fisher also had a close relationship with James Blunt. While working on his album "Back to Bedlam" in 2003, Blunt spent much of his time at Fisher's residence. "Vanity Fair's" George Wayne wanted Fisher to explain if their relationship was sexual. Fisher dismissed the suggestion: "Absolutely not, but I did become his therapist. He was a soldier. This boy has seen awful stuff. Every time James hears fireworks or anything like that, his heart beats faster, and he gets 'fight or flight.' You know, he comes from a long line of soldiers dating back to the 10th century. He would tell me these horrible stories. He was a captain, a reconnaissance soldier. I became Jamesâ€™s therapist. So it would have been unethical to sleep with my patient."
On February 26, 2005, R. Gregory "Greg" Stevens, a lobbyist and advisor for the Republican Party, was found dead in Fisher's California home due to an overdose of OxyContin compounded by obstructive sleep apnea. In an interview, Fisher claimed that Stevens's ghost haunted her mansion, which unsettled her: "I was a nut for a year," she explained, "and in that year I took drugs again."
Fisher has described herself as an "enthusiastic agnostic who would be happy to be shown that there is a God." She was raised Protestant, but often attends Jewish services, the faith of her father, with Orthodox friends. She was a spokesperson for Jenny Craig, Inc. Television ads airing in late January 2011.
Bipolar disorder and drug problems.
Fisher has publicly discussed her problems with drugs, her struggle with bipolar disorder, and her overcoming an addiction to prescription medication, most notably on ABC's "20/20" and "The Secret Life of the Manic Depressive" with Stephen Fry for the BBC. She discussed her 2008 memoir "Wishful Drinking" and various topics in it with Matt Lauer on NBC's "Today" on December 10, 2008 and also revealed that she wished she had turned down the role of Leia Organa. This interview was followed by a similar appearance on "The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson" on December 12, 2008, where she discussed her electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) treatments. She has said that she receives ECT every six weeks to "blow apart the cement" in her brain.
While in Sydney, Australia, Fisher revealed in another interview that she had a cocaine addiction during filming of "Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back", and also survived an overdose. "Slowly, I realized I was doing a bit more drugs than other people and losing my choice in the matter", she said in an interview.

In the human anatomy, the chin is the lowermost part of the face. The area of the chin is known anatomically as the mental region. It tends to be more pointed and triangular in human females, while more square shaped in human males. It is formed by the lower front of the mandible. In humans there is a wide variety of chin structures, e.g. cleft chin.
The chin developed as a point of muscular attachment facilitating minute movements of the lips associated with speech. In human evolution, the chin is a cladistic apomorphy, partially defining anatomically modern humans as distinct from archaic forms. Non-human anthropoid apes have a simian shelf for example. The elephant is the only other animal considered to display such a feature, although this leads to debate over the use of the term.
Whilst it is agreed that the chin emerged during the Middle and Late Pleistocene, its origin and biomechanical significance are the subjects of controversy. Prominent hypotheses include buttressing the jaw against stresses resulting from speech or chewing as well as simple sexual selection through mate choice. With the advent of more advanced computational facilities, finite element analyses have been used to support hypotheses involving mechanical stress. On the other hand increased availability of data regarding sexual dimorphism in chins has also lent support to the sexual selection hypothesis as sexual dimorphism is more difficult to explain under other regimes. It is possible that multiple causal factors have played a role in the evolution of this bony protuberance.

As a schoolboy, he performed in plays, including in the role of Willy Wonka in a production of "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory", Jack in his school play "Jack and the Beanstalk" and Robin Hood in the adaptation of "The Adventures of Robin Hood" (1938). Pettyfer was educated at two junior independent schools: The Mall School, a small school in Twickenham, followed by the Lambrook Haileybury school in Berkshire.

Career.
In 2005, after a modelling career, Pettyfer made his professional acting d√©but in the British television production of "Tom Brown's Schooldays", playing the lead character, Tom Brown; he received positive reviews for the role. In June 2005, he was cast in his most prominent role so far, that of teenage MI6 spy Alex Rider in the film "Stormbreaker", based on the novel by Anthony Horowitz. He was one of 500 who auditioned for the role. Pettyfer chose to appear in the film over a role in the film "Eragon", noting that he preferred "Stormbreaker" because it would be filmed in Britain, in the Isle of Man, while "Eragon" would film in Hungary; Pettyfer is afraid of flying, and he liked the looks of the cast for "Stormbreaker". "Stormbreaker" was released on 21 July 2006 in the United Kingdom, on 6 October 2006 in the United States and on 21 September 2006 in Australia.
One review of Pettyfer's performance described him as playing the role with an "earnest intensity", although another noted that he "isn't quite at ease as an actor". Media reports specified that the film was expected to make Pettyfer a "teen idol". Pettyfer will not reprise the role if there is another Alex Rider film because he is now too mature for the role.
He next appeared in "Wild Child", a film set in California, Kent and Yorkshire part of which took place at Cobham Hall Girls' School in Kent. He played school boy Freddie Kingsley and he co-starred with Emma Roberts. In 2009, he played the callous ringleader of a group of cool but cruel teenagers who are picked off one by one by the ghost of one of their former victims, in the horror-comedy, "Tormented".
He starred in the film, "Beastly", based on the novel by Alex Flinn, alongside Mary-Kate Olsen, Vanessa Hudgens, and Neil Patrick Harris. He finished filming on 13 August 2009, and the film was released on 4 March 2011. Pettyfer portrayed the main character in "I Am Number Four", released in February 2011. The film co-starred Timothy Olyphant, Dianna Agron and Teresa Palmer, and was directed by D.J. Caruso, produced by Michael Bay, and executive produced by Steven Spielberg.

After Pettyfer completed filming "Stormbreaker", he did not discuss the film with anyone at his school, citing the advice of his "Stormbreaker" co-star, Ewan McGregor, who told him to keep his personal and professional lives separate. Pettyfer has since decided to leave school and concentrate on his film career, while studying drama at college, saying that "When you have already experienced going out and working in the real world, and you come back to school, you just see it as a playground and you don't want to be there any more".
Pettyfer has seven tattoos, including a Celtic cross on his chest, Tibetan script on the inside of his right arm, the words "What Goes Around Comes Around" in Arabic on his right shoulder, a Katakana script on his lower waist, and the letters "ER," the initials of ex-girlfriend Emma Roberts inside interlinking hearts on his right wrist. When Contactmusic asked him about the "ER" tattoo he said "I don't know how to say it, she's a lovely, lovely girl, we had a spell of something that is over now, but we're on good terms. She's beautiful, she's great; we're really good friends." The actor had gotten Roberts' name tattooed on his wrist while the two were dating. "I'm going to get asked about this, aren't I? I thought it was just between me and her," he said when asked about the tattoo.

DreamWorks Animation SKG, Inc. is an American animation studio based in Glendale, California that creates animated feature films, television programs, and online virtual worlds. They have released a total of twenty-five feature films, including the franchises of "Shrek", "Madagascar", "Kung Fu Panda", and "How to Train Your Dragon". As of October 2012, its feature films have made over $10 billion worldwide, with its $430 million average gross surpassing all other studios besides Pixar ($595 million). Four of DreamWorks Animation's films—"Shrek 2", "Shrek the Third", "Shrek Forever After", and "Madagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted"—are among the 50 highest-grossing films of all time, and fifteen of the films are among the 50 highest-grossing animated films, with "Shrek 2" being the fourth all-time highest.
Even though the studio also made traditionally-animated films about serious subjects earlier, such as "The Prince of Egypt", ', "The Road to El Dorado", ', and "", most of their computer-generated films and television series have now gained the studio a reputation for being focused on humor and satire although their most successful recent franchises have it balanced with more dramatic narratives.
The studio was formed by the merger of the feature animation division of DreamWorks and Pacific Data Images (PDI). Originally formed under the banner of DreamWorks in 1997 by some of Amblin Entertainment's former animation branch Amblimation alumni, it was spun off into a separate public company in 2004. DreamWorks Animation currently maintains two campuses: the original DreamWorks feature animation studio in Glendale, California and the PDI studio in Redwood City, California.
Films produced by DreamWorks Animation were formerly distributed worldwide by Paramount Pictures, a subsidiary of Viacom, who acquired the DreamWorks live-action studio in February 2006, spinning it off again in 2008. In 2013, however, 20th Century Fox, a subsidiary of News Corporation, will distribute DreamWorks Animation films for a 5-year-deal.
History.
1994–2004.
On October 12, 1994, DreamWorks SKG was formed and founded by a trio of entertainment players, director and producer Steven Spielberg, music executive David Geffen, and former Disney executive Jeffrey Katzenberg.
The new studio has attracted many artists from Spielberg's animation studio Amblimation. They first joined in 1995, when the last feature was completed, and the rest came in 1997, when the studio had shut down.
In 1995, DreamWorks signed a co-production deal with Pacific Data Images to form subsidiary PDI, LLC (PDI owned 60% of PDI, LLC, while DreamWorks SKG owned 40%). The new unit would produce computer-generated feature films beginning with "Antz" in 1998. In the same year DreamWorks SKG produced "The Prince of Egypt", which used both CG technology and traditional animation techniques.
In 1997, DreamWorks partnered with Aardman Animations, a British stop-motion animation studio, to co-produce and distribute "Chicken Run", a stop-motion film already in pre-production. Two years later they extended the deal for an additional four films. With Aardman doing stop-motion, they covered all three major styles, beside traditional and computer animation. This partnership had DreamWorks participating in the production of stop-motion films in Bristol, and also had Aardman participating in some of the CGI films made in the US.
In 2000, DreamWorks SKG created a new business division, DreamWorks Animation, that would regularly produce both types of animated feature films. The same year DW acquired majority interest (90%) in PDI, reforming it into PDI/DreamWorks, the Northern California branch of its new business division. Next year, "Shrek" was released and went on to win the first Academy Award for Best Animated Feature Film. Due to the success of CGI animated films, DWA decided the same year to exit hand-drawn animation business after the next two of total four hand-drawn films. Beginning with "Shrek 2", all released films, other than some co-produced with Aardman, are expected to be produced in CGI. Release of "Shrek 2" and "Shark Tale" also made DWA the first studio to produce two CG animated features in a single year.
The animation division was spun-off on October 27, 2004 into publicly traded company named DreamWorks Animation SKG, Inc. and headed by Katzenberg. DWA also inherited interests in PDI/DreamWorks. They made an agreement with their former parent to distribute all of their films until they deliver 12 new films, or December 12, 2010, whatever comes last.
2004–present.
On January 31, 2006, DWA entered into a distribution agreement with Paramount Pictures, which acquired DWA's former parent and distribution partner, DreamWorks SKG. The agreement granted Paramount the worldwide rights to distribute all animated films, including previously released until the delivery of 13 new animated feature films or December 31, 2012, whatever comes last.
Delivering three out five films, the partnership with Aardman ended after the release of "Flushed Away" in November 2006. The announcement was made before the film's release, on October 3, citing "creative differences" as the reason. DWA retained the co-ownership of rights to all films co-produced with Aardman, with an exception for "", for which they only kept rights for worldwide distribution.
On March 13, 2007, DreamWorks Animation announced it would release all of its films, beginning with "Monsters vs. Aliens" (2009), in stereoscopic 3D. Together with Intel they co-developed a new 3-D film-making technology InTru3D.
In 2008, DWA extended its production into India, where they established a special unit within Technicolor, named DreamWorks Dedicated Unit. DDU at first worked only on TV specials, such as "Merry Madagascar", and "Scared Shrekless", and DVD projects. With animating part of "Puss in Boots" (2011), they also started contributing to the feature films.
Since 2009, the studio has been a regular guest on the list of Fortune Magazine's 100 Best Companies to Work For. As the only entertainment company on the list, they ranked 47th in 2009, 6th in 2010, 10th in 2011, 14th in 2012, and 12th in 2013. The company is praised by its employees for its openness, culture of collaboration, and a free breakfast and lunch, a perk not found at many other companies.
With 2010, the studio had planned to release five feature films over the course of every two years, but the next year the studio revisited their plans, "But beyond 2012, Katzenberg said the studio will play it by ear, even if that means abandoning his proclamation that DWA would try to release three pictures in a single year, every other year." In 2010, DWA became the first studio that released three CG-animated films in a year.
The same year DreamWorks Animation created a new division named MoonBoy Animation. Its first show was "Neighbors from Hell", a collaboration with Fox Television Animation.
On February 17, 2012, DreamWorks Animation announced a joint venture with China Media Capital, Shanghai Media Group and Shanghai Alliance Investment to build a Shanghai based family entertainment company named Shanghai Oriental DreamWorks Film & Television Technology Co., Ltd. or Oriental DreamWorks for short. The new venture is expected to develop and produce original Chinese animated and live action content for distribution within China and worldwide. The company will also produce live entertainment content, theme parks, games and consumer products. Oriental DreamWorks, owned 45% by DWA and 55% by the Chinese partners, launched on August 6, 2012, with the cash and intellectual capital worth of $350 million. To produce animated films, 37 Entertainment, a Chinese animation studio with 175 employees, which had already worked on some DWA's television productions, has been acquired. Its first animated feature film, "Kung Fu Panda 3", is scheduled to be released in 2016, and will be made in co-production with DWA, with 1/3 of the film being produced in China. The studio's first original film will follow in 2017, and a film per year after that. A live action film is expected to be released within next two years. Part of the deal with the Chinese partners is also an entertainment and culture complex called Dream Center. Build in Shanghai with an investment exceeding $2.7 billion, it will feature series of theatres, cinemas, shopping areas, galleries, hotels, restaurants, and the world largest IMAX screen, and is expected to open in 2016.
In July 2012, DreamWorks Animation won a $155 million bid to acquire Classic Media, an owner of over 450 family entertainment titles and over 6,100 episodes of animated and live-action programming, including "Casper", "Lassie", "Rocky and Bullwinkle", "Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer", "Underdog", "Gumby", "Fat Albert", "Frosty the Snowman", "VeggieTales", and "Where's Waldo?". Classic Media will be renamed to DreamWorks Classics. Walt Disney Pictures is producing a live-action feature film adaptation of "The Lone Ranger" with the film rights acquired from DreamWorks Classics.
According to a Los Angeles Times report, DreamWorks Animation was in talks with Sony Pictures to distribute its upcoming films, such as "The Croods" and "Turbo". The report also mentioned a possibility where Sony would handle the United States distribution while 20th Century Fox would handle the international distribution. Renewal of the deal with Paramount was also open, but only with more favorable terms for Paramount. However, in August 2012, DreamWorks Animation signed a five-year distribution deal with 20th Century Fox for both domestic and international markets. "Rise of the Guardians" is the last DreamWorks Animation film to be distributed by Paramount Pictures, and "The Croods" will be the first DreamWorks Animation film to be distributed by 20th Century Fox.

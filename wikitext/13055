Production.
On March 14, 2012, CBS renewed "NCIS" for a tenth season which premiered on September 25, 2012. The season 10 production began in July 2012, a week after Michael Weatherly, Sean Murray and Pauley Perrette had signed their new contracts on the show. David McCallum signed his contract back in April 2012, while the rest of the cast was under contract for season 10. Also, Brian Dietzen, portraying Jimmy Palmer, was promoted to series regular for the season. Dietzen has been a recurring character on "NCIS" since late season 1.
The first part of the season consists of mostly standalone episodes, while the November two-part arc starts the "back half of the season". According to executive producer Gary Glasberg, the theme for the season is "fallen heroes". "The theme that weâ€™ve sort of been running with is fallen heroes and that picks up with the explosion that they go through, with the post-traumatic stress that they all experienced because of that". As a part of the "theme", a two-part episode "Shell Shock" aired in November, which focused on post-traumatic stress in the Navy, while the January episodes "Shabbat Shalom" and "Shiva" included the deaths of Eli David and Jackie Vance.
Joe Spano (FBI agent Fornell) appeared in the season premiere while Diane Neal (CGIS agent Abigail Borin), Ralph Waite (Jackson Gibbs), Robert Wagner (Tony DiNozzo, Sr.) and Michael Nouri appeared later in the season.
Beginning with season 10, CBS released "phoofs" from the episodes on cbs.com some days before the episodes aired.

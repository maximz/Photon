His stage name was tribute to an instrument he used in the 1980s, the Oberheim DMX drum machine and later was interpreted as "Dark Man X".
A year later, Columbia Records signed DMX to their subsidiary label Ruffhouse, who released his debut single "Born Loser". The single did not get much airplay. The label eventually agreed to release DMX from their contract. He released his second single, "Make a Move" in 1994, and made a guest appearance on LL Cool J's single "4, 3, 2, 1" in 1997. Additional guest spots on Mase singles "24 Hours to Live" and "Take What's Yours", and The LOX's single "Money, Power & Respect" created a strong buzz. DMX also made a cameo appearance in the Sum 41 music video for "Makes No Difference". At WrestleMania XXVII, during a promo package for professional wrestler John Cena, DMX gave a special sermon, which reflects his ministry beliefs and the church-like entrance of Cena.

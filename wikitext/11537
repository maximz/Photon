"Forbes" list of billionaires is an annual ranking of the world's wealthiest people, compiled and published by "Forbes", an American national business magazine. The total net worth of each indivdual on the list is estimated, in United States dollars, based on their assets and accounting for debt. The list only represents each person's valuation on a single day, due to daily fluctuations among exchange rates and stock valuations.
Statistics.
The Internet bubble created the most paper wealth for some billionaires. However, once the dotcom bubble burst the new rich saw their fortunes disappear. Billionaires' fortunes have been hit even harder by the global financial crisis. 2009 was the first time in five years that the world had a net loss in the number of billionaires. The strong performance of the financial markets and global economic recovery have erased financial assets losses. Most of the richest people on the planet have seen their fortunes soar in the past few years.

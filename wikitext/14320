Searching for Sugar Man is a Swedish/British documentary directed by Malik Bendjelloul, detailing the efforts of two Cape Town fans, Stephen 'Sugar' Segerman and Craig Bartholomew Strydom, to find out if the rumored death of American musician Rodriguez was true, and, if not, to discover what had become of him. Rodriguez's music, which never took off in the United States, had become wildly popular in South Africa, but little was known about him there. The film is produced by Simon Chinn and John Battsek. In February 2013 it won the Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature.
Production.
Initially using 8 mm film to record the movie, director Bendjelloul ran out of money for more film to record the final few shots. He resorted to filming the remaining shots on his smartphone using an app called 8mm Vintage Camera to complete the film.

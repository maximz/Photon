Suburgatory is an American sitcom television series created by Emily Kapnek, airing on ABC. The series premiered on September 28, 2011, airing on Wednesday nights at 8:30/7:30 Central following "The Middle". The title is a portmanteau, thought up by former CNN Senior Producer Linda Keenan, of the words "suburban" and "purgatory". On May 10, 2012, the show was renewed for a second season, which premiered on October 17, 2012.
Premise.
The series follows George Altman, a single father who decides to get away from New York City to the suburbs so he can give his teenage daughter, Tessa, a better life. However, their move to the suburbs has the daughter wondering if they just entered the world of "The Stepford Wives" after they see how "perfect" their new locale is, right down to the neighbors who welcome them into the cul-de-sac.
Production.
The series first appeared on ABC's development slate in October 2010. On January 14, 2011, ABC placed a pilot order, written by Emily Kapnek and directed by Michael Fresco, who also serve as executive producers. The half-hour comedy is produced by Warner Bros. Television.
Casting announcements began in February 2011, with Jane Levy the first actor cast, playing the role of Tessa Altman, a Manhattan teen who has been raised for the last fifteen years by a single father, George. Tessa dreads the idea of living in the suburbs. Next to join the series was Alan Tudyk in the role of Noah Werner, George's college buddy and a dentist who moved to the suburbs some years earlier. Allie Grant then joined the series as Lisa Shay, a socially awkward girl at school who befriends Tessa. Jeremy Sisto and Carly Chaikin followed with Sisto playing George Altman, Tessa's architect father who moves her from Manhattan to the suburbs, and Chaikin playing Dalia Royce, Tessa's neighbor who quickly becomes her nemesis at school. Cheryl Hines was next cast in the role of Dallas Royce, a well-to-do housewife and the mother of Dalia. She tells George that her absentee husband (Jay Mohr) "travels a lot". Rex Lee was the last actor cast, playing Mr. Wolfe, Tessa's clueless high school guidance counselor. He was originally a guest star but was upped to a series regular after the pilot.
"Saturday Night Live" ("SNL") alumna Ana Gasteyer plays the Altmans' domineering neighbor, Sheila Shay, whom they vainly try to avoid. Fellow "SNL" alum Chris Parnell plays Fred, her husband, who toes the line. The Shays have two children: Lisa, who is Tessa's closest thing to a friend, and Ryan (Parker Young).
On May 13, 2011, ABC ordered the pilot to series, to air in the fall of the 2011–12 United States network television schedule. "Suburgatory" premiered on September 28, 2011 and currently airs on Wednesday nights at 8:30/7:30 central following "The Middle". After initially ordering 11 episodes, ABC picked up "Suburgatory" for a full season on October 13, 2011. On December 16, 2011, it was announced that Alicia Silverstone would have a recurring role as Eden, a potential love interest for single father George. This marked the third time Silverstone and Jeremy Sisto had worked together, since first working on the 1995 American comedy film "Clueless", and the 1995 thriller "Hideaway".
On March 23, 2012, ABC announced that the series was renewed for the 2012–2013 television season. It would air after "Modern Family", on 9:30/8:30 central timeslot replacing the new series "The Neighbors" which was originally scheduled to air in that timeslot.
Theme song.
The theme song, "Pleasant Nightmare", was written by Jared Faber and Emily Kapnek and is sung by Alih Jey. The theme song is slightly different in episode 22 (the last episode of season 1). In the season 2 premiere, Tessa performs a longer version of the song, which she says her mother wrote.
Location and setting.
The series takes place in the fictional town of Chatswin. According to the onscreen map animation displayed in the opening credits, the true location of the town is in southern Westchester County, an affluent suburban county north of New York City. The 914 area code would also indicate it is in Westchester County. In episode 13, George Altman enters his zip-code as 10805, which is a postal code in New Rochelle, New York.
The series takes its title from "Suburgatory: Twisted Tales from Darkest Suburbia", a book by former CNN Senior Producer Linda Keenan, based in part on her experiences after she moved from New York City to three affluent suburbs, the first of which was in Westchester County. The book, released on October 11, 2011, thirteen days after the show premiered, is described on the front cover as "The Title behind the ABC Sitcom".
Critical reception.
The show has been met with generally positive reviews, with an initial score of 70 out of 100 from Metacritic. "Kapnek manages to make a show that is both satiric and emotionally engaging", said David Wiegand of the "San Francisco Chronicle", "two varieties of comedy don't always work well together." On the other end, Neil Genzlinger of "The New York Times" blasted the show. "[It begins with a tenuous premise, uses it to leap to an inaccurate dichotomy and supports that with tired, unfunny stereotypes."
Ratings.
The debut episode did well, scoring a 3.3 among the 18–49 demos with 9.81 million viewers tuning in.
Later episodes of the show have been performing well, with steady ratings so far during its first season. As of January 12, 2012, the show's viewership has averaged 8.7 million.
Awards and nominations.
"Suburgatory" was nominated for a 2012 People's Choice Award for "Favorite New TV Comedy", but lost to "2 Broke Girls".

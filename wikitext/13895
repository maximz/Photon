Early life and education.
Leech was born in Killiney, County Dublin, Ireland to David Leech, the CEO of a computer systems company, and Kay Leech, a housewife. He is the third of four children; he has an older brother Greg, an older sister Ali, and a younger brother Simon. He has stated that he had a "strong family life." He attended St Michael's College. As a child, he was overweight and was bullied. Because of this, he became introverted and stated, "Until I was 15 I was cripplingly shy and refused to go out the front door." He became interested in acting at 11 when he was given the part of the Cowardly Lion in a school production of "The Wizard of Oz" and found he loved being on stage. He recalled how he immediately decided to become an actor when Peter McDonald told him how acting is a profession on the last night of the production's run. Afterwards, drama became the "focal point" of his teenage years, apart from his family life, and drama and family support helped him through his school years. He became set on acting after winning a small role in a 1998 production of "A Streetcar Named Desire" at the Gate Theatre. Though his parents wanted him to become an architect, his parents supported his decision on the condition that he earn a degree to fall back on. He earned a Bachelor of Arts and a Master's Degree in Drama and Theatre Studies from Trinity College, Dublin, later noting that this was a "loophole" in his parents' condition. He landed his first major roles in "Cowboys & Angels" and "Man About Dog" while at Trinity, and he has admitted that he did little schoolwork because he spent his time on auditions and acting.

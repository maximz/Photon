Francois Hougaard (born 6 April 1988) is a professional South African rugby union rugby player. His primary position is scrumhalf, but in recent times his blistering pace has seen him being deployed on the wing for the Bulls. He was born in Paarl, South Africa and his first tour with the Springboks was to France, Italy, Ireland and England in late 2009 where he played in one test against Italy on 21 November 2009 and two touring matches.
Hougaard won the Currie Cup in 2009, and the Super Rugby title in 2010, scoring tries in both finals.
2009.
He scored a try in the Currie Cup final win 36-24 against the Free State Cheetahs (3rd min) following a superb crosskick from Fourie du Preez for his first final at 21 (the youngest player in the starting line) wearing the number 14 jersey.
2011.
In the 2011 Super Rugby season, he showed great promise, adapting to his self proclaimed preferred position of scrum half in the absence of Fourie Du Preez, very well, and as a result, landed a position in the Springbok World Cup Squad for the 2011 tournament. At school he played for Paul Roos Gymnasium.
2011 Rugby World Cup.
Hougaard was selected and joined off the bench for South Africa's opening match scoring in the 65th minute in a 17-16 win over Wales. He was however dropped for the second game against Fiji which South Africa won 49-3 but started against Namibia in which he scored two tries and came off the bench against Samoa. South Africa was however knocked out of the cup, losing 11-9 to Australia. Hougaard came on in the 50th minute during that match.
2012 mid-year tests.
Hougaard started all five games at scrum half against England and Argentina and scored one try against England. However, he was moved to the wing and his place at scrum half taken by the talented Ruan Pienaar in the first Championship Test against Australia on 8 September 2012.

The following is a list of gods and other divine and semi-divine figures from Greek mythology. The list does not include creatures; for these, see "List of Greek mythological creatures".
Immortals.
Olympian deities.
The Greeks created images of their deities for many purposes. A temple would house the statue of a god or goddess, or multiple deities, and might be decorated with relief scenes depicting myths. Divine images were common on coins. Drinking cups and other vessels were painted with scenes from myths.
Titans.
The Titans are depicted in Greek art less commonly than the Olympians.

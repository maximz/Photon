Colin Andrew Firth, (born 10 September 1960) is an English film, television, and theatre actor. His films have earned more than $936 million from 42 releases worldwide. He has received an Academy Award, a Golden Globe, a BAFTA and the Screen Actors Guild Award, as well as the Volpi Cup. His most notable and acclaimed role to date has been his 2011 portrayal of King George VI in "The King's Speech", a performance that gained him an Oscar and many other worldwide best actor awards. It went on to gross $414,211,549 worldwide.
Identified in the late 1980s with the 'Brit Pack' of new young British actors, along with Gary Oldman and Tim Roth, Firth's rise to stardom progressed at a slower pace than many of his contemporaries. It was not until his portrayal of Mr. Darcy in the 1995 television adaptation of Jane Austen's "Pride and Prejudice" that Firth became a household name. The show was a hit in the UK and USA and established him as a light comic leading man. This led to roles in films such as "The English Patient", "Bridget Jones's Diary" (for which he was nominated for a BAFTA), "Shakespeare in Love" and "Love Actually". In 2010 he received widespread critical acclaim for his leading role in "A Single Man", for which Firth gained his first Academy Award nomination, and won a BAFTA Award.
In 2011, he received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame and was also selected as one of The "Time 100". He was awarded an honorary degree from the University of Winchester in 2007, and was made a Freeman of the City of London in 2012.
Firth has campaigned for the rights of indigenous tribal peoples and is a member of Survival International. He has also campaigned on issues of asylum seekers and refugees' rights and the environment. Firth commissioned and is credited as a co-author on a scientific paper on a study into the differences in brain structure between people of differing political orientations.
Early life.
Firth was born in Grayshott, Hampshire to parents who were both academics and teachers. His mother, Shirley Jean (née Rolles), was a comparative religion lecturer at King Alfred's College, Winchester (now the University of Winchester), and his father, David Norman Lewis Firth, was a history lecturer (also at King Alfred's) and education officer for the Nigerian Government. Firth has a sister, Kate, and a younger brother, Jonathan, who is also an actor. Firth's parents were raised in India, because his maternal grandparents, Congregationalist ministers, and his paternal grandfather, an Anglican priest, performed overseas missionary work. 
As a child Firth travelled a lot due to his parents work, spending some years in Nigeria. He also lived in St. Louis, Missouri when he was 11. Firth described this as a difficult time, and he struggled to fit in. On returning to the UK he attended the Montgomery of Alamein Secondary School (now Kings' School), which at the time was a state comprehensive school in Winchester, Hampshire. He was still an outsider and was the target of bullying. To counter this he adopted the local working class Hampshire accent, and affected a disinterest in schoolwork. By the time he was fourteen, Firth had already decided he wanted to be a professional actor, having attended drama workshops from the age of ten. Until further education, he was not academically inclined, later saying in an interview "I didn't like school. I just thought it was boring and mediocre and nothing they taught me seemed to be of any interest at all." However, at Barton Peveril Sixth Form College in Eastleigh he became instilled with a love of English literature thanks to an enthusiastic teacher, Penny Edwards, and has said that "My two years at Barton Peveril were among the two happiest years of my life".
After his sixth form years, Firth moved to London and joined the National Youth Theatre, where he made many contacts in the acting world, from which he got a job in the wardrobe department at the National Theatre. From there he went on to study at London's Drama Centre.
Career.
1983–1994, "Brit Pack" boy.
Playing Hamlet in the Drama Centre end of year production, Firth was spotted by playwright Julian Mitchell, who cast him as Marxist public schoolboy Tommy Judd in the 1983 West End production of "Another Country". In 1984 he reprised the role for his film debut in the screen adaptation of the play (opposite Rupert Everett). This was the start of a longstanding public feud between Firth and Everett, which was later resolved. He starred with Sir Laurence Olivier in "Lost Empires" (1986), a TV adaptation of J. B. Priestley's novel. In 1987, Firth along with other up and coming British actors such as Tim Roth, Bruce Payne and Paul McGann were dubbed the 'Brit Pack'. That same year he appeared alongside Kenneth Branagh in the film version of J. L. Carr's "A Month in the Country". Sheila Johnston observed a theme in his early works of playing those traumatised by war. Firth portrayed real-life British soldier Robert Lawrence MC in the 1988 BBC dramatisation Tumbledown. Lawrence was severely injured at the Battle of Mount Tumbledown during in the Falklands War, and the film details his struggles to adjust to his disability whilst confronted with indifference from the government and the public. The film attracted controversy at the time, with criticism coming from left and right ends of the politcal spectrum. Firth's performance led to a Royal TV Society Best Actor Award and he was nominated for the 1989 BAFTA Television Award. In 1989 he played the title role in Miloš Forman's "Valmont", based on "Les Liaisons dangereuses". This was released just a year after "Dangerous Liaisons", and did not make a big impact in comparison. The same year he played a paranoid, socially awkward character in Argentinian psychological thriller "Apartment Zero".
1995–2003, English romantic ("Pride and Prejudice").
It was through his role as the aloof and haughty aristocrat Mr Darcy in the 1995 BBC television adaptation of Jane Austen's "Pride and Prejudice" that Firth finally became a household name. He was producer Sue Birtwistle's first choice for the part, eventually being persuaded to take it, despite initial reluctance as he was unfamiliar with Austen's writing. Firth and co-star Jennifer Ehle began a romantic relationship during the filming of the series, which only received media attention after the couple's separation. Sheila Johnston wrote that Firth's approach to the part "lent Darcy complex shades of coldness, even caddishness, in the early episodes." The serial was a major international success, and unexpectedly elevated Firth to stardom, in some part due to an iconic scene in which he emerged in a wet shirt after swimming. Although Firth did not mind being recognised as "a romantic idol as a Darcy with smouldering sex appeal" in a role that "officially turned him into a heart-throb", he expressed the wish not to be associated with "Pride and Prejudice" forever. He was therefore reluctant to accept similar roles and risk becoming typecast. For a time it did seem as if Mr Darcy would overshadow the rest of his career, and there were humourous allusions to the role in his next five movies. The most notable of these was the casting of Firth as love interest Mark Darcy in the film adaptation of "Bridget Jones's Diary", itself a modern day retelling of "Pride and Prejudice". Firth accepted the part as he saw it as an opportunity to lampoon his Mr Darcy character. The film was very successful and critically well liked. A in 2004 was mostly panned by critics but was still financially successful. Firth had a supporting role in "The English Patient" (1996) playing the husband of Kristin Scott Thomas's character, whose jealousy about her adultery leads to both their deaths. He had parts in light romantic period pieces such as "Shakespeare in Love" (1998), "Relative Values" (2000) and "The Importance of Being Earnest" (2002). He played a less debonair romantic lead as a laddish, football obsessed teacher in 1997's "Fever Pitch" (1997). He appeared in several television productions, including "Donovan Quick" (an updated version of "Don Quixote") (1999) and had a more serious and villainous role as Dr Wilhelm Stuckart in "Conspiracy" (2001), concerning the Nazi Wannsee Conference; Firth was Emmy nominated for his role.
2003–2009, ensemble player ("Love Actually", "Mamma Mia!").
Firth featured in the ensemble all-star cast of Richard Curtis's "Love Actually" (2003), another financial success, which divided critics in their love of the film. In contrast, that year Firth was also given solo billing as the romantic lead in "Hope Springs", but the film received very poor reviews and made little impact at the box office. Firth played the painter Johannes Vermeer opposite Scarlett Johansson in the 2003 release "Girl with a Pearl Earring". Some critics praised the film's gentle subtlety and sumptuous visuals, whilst others found it almost too restrained, tedious and bereft of emotion. Nevertheless the film had mostly favourable reviews, was moderately successful with audiences and gained several awards and nominations. 2005's "Nanny McPhee" with Emma Thompson was a rare venture for Firth into the fantasy genre. "Where the Truth Lies" from that year was also a departure from light comedies, this time a return to some of Firth's darker, more intense early roles, with a notorious scene featuring him involved in a bisexual orgy. Sheila Johnston wrote that it "confounded his fans" but despite that his character "draws knowingly on that suave, cultivated persona." which could be traced from Mr. Darcy. Other films from this time include "Then She Found Me" (2007) with Helen Hunt and "The Last Legion" (2007) with Aishwarya Rai. In 2008 he played the adult Blake Morrison reminiscing on his difficult relationship with his ailing father in the film adaptation of Morrison's memoir "And When Did You Last See Your Father?." The film received generally favorable reviews.Peter Bradshaw of "The Guardian" rated the film four out of five stars.Manohla Dargis in the "New York Times" said "It’s a pleasure to watch Mr. Firth — a supremely controlled actor who makes each developing fissure visible — show the adult Blake coming to terms with his contradictory feelings, letting the love and the hurt pour out of him."Philip French of "The Observer" wrote that Firth "quiet agonising to perfection." However, Derek Elley of "Variety" called the film "an unashamed tearjerker that’s all wrapping and no center." While he conceded that it was "undeniably effective at a gut level despite its dramatic shortcomings," he added that "Things aren’t helped any by Firth’s dour perf, as his Blake comes across as a self-centered whiner, a latter-day Me Generation figure who’s obsessed with finding problems when there really aren’t any."
 The film adaptation of "Mamma Mia!" (2008), was Firths' first foray into musicals, and he described the experience as "a bit nerve-racking" but believed he got off lightly by being tasked with one of the less demanding songs, "Our Last Summer". "Mamma Mia" became the highest grossing British-made film of all time, taking over $600 million worldwide. As with "Love Actually", it polarised critics in their opinions, with supporters such as "Empire" calling it "cute, clean, camp fun, full of sunshine and toe tappers." whereas Peter Bradshaw in "The Guardian" said the film gave him a "need to vomit". Judy Cramer in "The Philadelphia Inquirer" described Firth's performance as "the embodiment of forced mirth." That year Firth also starred in "Easy Virtue", which screened at the Rome Film Festival to excellent reviews. Firth starred in "Genova" which premiered at the 2008 Toronto International Film Festival.
In 2009, he featured in "A Christmas Carol", an adaptation of Charles Dickens's novel, using the performance capture procedure, playing Scrooge's optimistic nephew Fred.
2009–2011, "The King's Speech", awards success.
At the 66th Venice International Film Festival in 2009 Firth was awarded the Volpi Cup for Best Actor for his role in Tom Ford's directorial debut "A Single Man" as a college professor grappling with solitude after his longtime partner dies. His performance earned Firth career best reviews and Academy Award, Golden Globe, Screen Actors' Guild, BAFTA, and BFCA nominations; he won the BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role in February 2010.
Firth starred in the 2010 film "The King's Speech" as Prince Albert, Duke of York/King George VI. The film details him working to overcome his speech impediment while becoming monarch of the United Kingdom at the end of 1936. At the Toronto International Film Festival (TIFF), the film was met with a standing ovation. The TIFF release of "The King's Speech" fell on Colin's 50th birthday and was called the "best 50th birthday gift". On 16 January 2011, he won a Golden Globe for his performance in "The King's Speech" in the category of Best Performance by an Actor in a Motion Picture – Drama. The Screen Actors Guild recognised Firth with the award for Best Male Actor for "The King's Speech" on 30 January 2011.
In February 2011 he won the best actor award at the 2011 BAFTA awards. He received an Academy Award for Best Actor in a motion picture for "The King's Speech" on 27 February 2011.
Firth appeared as senior British secret agent Bill Haydon in the 2011 adaptation of the John le Carré novel "Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy", directed by Tomas Alfredson, also starring Gary Oldman and Tom Hardy. The film gathered mostly excellent reviews. "The Independent" described Firth's performance as "suavely arrogant" and praised the film. Deborah Young in "The Hollywood Reporter" thought Firth got "all the best dialogue", which he delivered "sardonically". Leslie Felperin in "Variety" wrote that all the actors brought their "A game" and Firth was in "particularly choleric, amusing form." However, Peter Hitchens writing in the "Daily Mail" expressed reservations that Firth looked too young for the part (even though he technically was) being "of the post-war generation, who escaped wartime privation," and therefore not "old enough or ravaged enough".
2011–present.
In May 2011 Firth began filming "Gambit" – a remake of a 1960s crime caper, taking a part played in the original by Michael Caine. It was released in the UK in November 2012 and was a financial and critical failure., attracting many negative reviews Empire's Kim Newman wrote "Firth starts out homaging Caine with his horn-rimmed cool but soon defaults to his usual repressed British clod mode", whilst Time Out London called his a "likeable performance" although disliking the film overall. Stephen Dalton writing in the "The Hollywood Reporter" said "To his credit, Firth keeps his performance grounded in downbeat realism while all around are wildly mugging in desperate pursuit of thin, forced laughs. 
 He has been scheduled to appear in Rupert Everett's directorial debut "The Happy Prince", an Oscar Wilde biopic. Firth will play Wilde's friend Reginald "Reggie" Turner. Shooting was planned for summer 2013, with the film due to be released in 2014. Firth was also expected to return for the third Bridget Jones film, which was in production in 2012.
Firth is also due to star in the film "Genius", playing literary editor Max Perkins alongside Michael Fassbender as author Thomas Wolfe. The film, which is based on A. Scott Berg's biography "", is due to begin filming in early 2014.
Other work.
Firth's first published work, "The Department of Nothing", appeared in "Speaking with the Angel" (2000). This collection of short stories was edited by Nick Hornby and was published to benefit the TreeHouse Trust, in aid of autistic children. Firth had previously met Hornby during the filming of the original "Fever Pitch". Colin Firth contributed with his writing for the book, "We Are One: A Celebration of Tribal Peoples", released in 2009. The book explores the culture of peoples around the world, portraying both its diversity and facing threats. It counts with the contributions of many western writers, such as Laurens van der Post, Noam Chomsky, Claude Lévi-Strauss; and also indigenous peoples, such as Davi Kopenawa Yanomami and Roy Sesana. The royalties from the sale of this book go to the indigenous rights organisation, Survival International. In December 2010, Firth was guest editor on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, during which he commissioned research to scan the brains of politicians to see if there were any differences depending on political leanings. He was then credited as one of four co-authors of an academic paper into human brains, the others being University College London researchers. The results of the study suggested that conservatives have greater amygdala volume and liberals have greater volume in their anterior cingulate cortex.
In 2012, Firth's audiobook performance of Graham Greene's "The End of the Affair" was released at Audible.com.
Personal life.
Firth lives in Chiswick, London. In 1989, he entered into a romantic relationship with actress Meg Tilly, his co-star in "Valmont". In 1990, they had a son, William "Will" Joseph Firth, and moved to near the Lower Mainland of British Columbia, Canada. Firth's acting career slowed down until the couple's split in 1994, and his return to the UK. Firth remains in contact with Will and with Tilly's two other children. On the set of "Pride and Prejudice", Firth became involved with his co-star Jennifer Ehle; however, the two broke up and in 1997 Firth married Italian film producer/director Livia Giuggioli. The couple now lives in both London and Italy. They have two sons, Luca (born March 2001) and Matteo (born August 2003). Firth started to learn Italian when he and Giuggioli began to date and he now is fluent in the language. Firth is a supporter of Southampton F.C..

Activism.
Firth has been a long-standing supporter of Survival International, a non-governmental organisation that defends the rights of tribal peoples. Speaking in 2001, he said, "My interest in tribal peoples goes back many years... and I have supported ever since." In 2003, during the promotion of the film "Love Actually", he spoke in defence of the tribal people of Botswana, condemning the Botswana government's eviction of the Gana and Gwi Bushmen from the Central Kalahari Game Reserve. He says of the Bushmen, "These people are not the remnants of a past era who need to be brought up to date. Those who are able to continue to live on the land that is rightfully theirs are facing the 21st century with a confidence that many of us in the so-called developed world can only envy." He has also backed a Survival International campaign to press the Brazilian government to take more decisive action in defence of the Awá-Guajá people, whose land and livelihood is critically threatened by the actions of loggers.
As a supporter of the Refugee Council, Firth was involved in a campaign to stop the deportation of a group of 42 Congolese asylum seekers, expressing concerns in open letters to "The Independent" and "The Guardian" that they faced being murdered on their return to the Democratic Republic of Congo. Firth said "To me it's just basic civilisation to help people. I find this incredibly painful to see how we dismiss the most desperate people in our society. It's easily done. It plays to the tabloids, to the Middle-England xenophobes. It just makes me furious. And all from a government we once had such high hopes for". 4 of the asylum seekers were given a last-minute reprieve from deportation.
Firth along with other celebrities has been involved in the Oxfam global campaign Make Trade Fair, focusing on trade practices seen as especially unfair to third world producers including dumping, high import tariffs, and labour rights. He has further contributed to this cause by opening (with a few collaborators) an eco-friendly shop in West London, Eco. The shop offers fair trade and eco-friendly goods, as well as expert advice on making spaces more energy efficient. In October 2009 at the London Film Festival, Firth launched a film and political activism website, Brightwide, along with his wife Livia.
During to the 2010 General Election Firth announced his support for the Liberal Democrats, having previously been a Labour supporter, citing asylum and refugees' rights as a key reason for his change in affiliation. In December 2010, Firth publicly dropped his support of the Liberal Democrats, citing their U-turn on tuition fees as one of the key reasons for his disillusionment. He also said that while he no longer supports the Liberal Democrats, he is currently without an affiliation. Firth appeared in literature to support changing the British electoral system from first-past-the-post to alternative vote for electing Members of Parliament to the House of Commons in the unsuccessful Alternative Vote referendum in 2011. In 2009 Firth joined the project, supporting the movement calling for people to reduce their carbon footprint. In 2010 Colin endorsed the "Roots & Shoots" education programme in the UK run by the Jane Goodall Institute (UK).
He was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 2011 Birthday Honours for services to drama.

Career.
Actor.
Aamir Khan began his film career at the age of 8, as a child actor in a home production, made by Nasir Hussain, titled "Yaadon Ki Baaraat" (1973) and "Madhosh" (1974). Eleven years later, he made his adult acting debut in a role that went quite unnoticed in Ketan Mehta's "Holi" (1984).
Khan's first notable leading role came in 1988 in the film "Qayamat Se Qayamat Tak" which was directed by his cousin and Nasir Hussain's son Mansoor Khan. This film was a breakthrough commercial success, effectively launching Khan's career as a leading actor. Having the typical 'chocolate hero' looks, he was publicised as a teen idol. He also starred in critically acclaimed film "Raakh", for which Khan got his first National Award for Special Jury Award. After that, he went on to appear in several other films in the late '80s and early '90s: "Dil" (1990), which became the highest grossing film of the year, "Dil Hai Ke Manta Nahin" (1991), "Jo Jeeta Wohi Sikandar" (1992), "Hum Hain Rahi Pyar Ke" (1993) (for which he also wrote the screenplay), and "Rangeela" (1995). Most of these films were successful critically and commercially. Other successes include "Andaz Apna Apna", co-starring Salman Khan. At the time of its release the movie was reviewed unfavorably by critics, but over the years has gained a cult status.
Khan continued to act in just one or two films a year, an unusual trait for a mainstream Hindi cinema actor. His only release in 1996 was the Dharmesh Darshan directed commercial blockbuster "Raja Hindustani" in which he was paired opposite Karisma Kapoor. The film earned him his first Filmfare Best Actor Award, after seven previous nominations, and went on to become the biggest hit of the year, as well as the third highest grossing Indian film of the 1990s. Khan's career had seemed to hit a plateau at this point of time, and most of the films to follow for the next few years were only partially successful. In 1997, he co-starred alongside Ajay Devgn, Kajol and Juhi Chawla in "Ishq", which performed well at the box office. The following year, Khan appeared in the moderately successful "Ghulam", for which he also did playback singing. John Mathew Matthan's "Sarfarosh" (1999), Khan's first release in 1999, was also moderately successful, gaining an above average box office verdict. The film was highly appreciated amongst the critics and Khan's role as a dedicated, honest and uncorrupted cop engaged in fighting border terrorism, was well received, as was his role in Deepa Mehta's art house film "Earth". His first release for the new millennium, "Mela", in which he acted alongside his real-life brother Faisal Khan, was both a box-office and critical bomb.
In 2001 he appeared in "Lagaan". The film was a major critical and commercial success, and received a nomination for Best Foreign Language Film at the 74th Academy Awards. Additionally, the film gathered critical acclaim at several international film festivals, in addition to winning numerous Indian awards, including the National Film Awards. Khan himself won his second Filmfare Best Actor Award. The film continues to be one of the most popular Hindi films in the west.
The success of "Lagaan" was followed by "Dil Chahta Hai" later that year, in which Khan co-starred with Saif Ali Khan and Akshaye Khanna, with Preity Zinta playing his love interest. The film was written and directed by the then newcomer Farhan Akhtar. According to critics, the film broke new grounds by showing Indian urban youth as they really are today. The characters depicted were modern, suave and cosmopolitan. The film did moderately well and was a success mostly in urban cities.
Khan then took a four-year break citing personal problems, and returned in 2005 with Ketan Mehta's "" playing the title role of a real-life sepoy and a martyr who helped spark the Indian Rebellion of 1857 or the 'First War of Indian Independence'.
Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra's award-winning "Rang De Basanti" was Khan's first release in 2006. His role was critically acclaimed, earning him a Filmfare Critics Award for Best Actor and various nominations for "Best Actor". The film went on to become one of the highest grossing films of the year, and was selected as India's official entry to the Oscars. Although the film was not shortlisted as a nominee for the Oscar, it received a nomination for Best Foreign Film at the BAFTA Awards in England. Khan's work in his next movie, "Fanaa" (2006) co-starred with Kajol was also appreciated, and the film went on to become one of the highest grossing Indian films of 2006.
His 2007 film, "Taare Zameen Par" was also produced by him and marked his directorial debut. The film, which was the second offering from "Aamir Khan Productions", starred Khan in a supporting role as a teacher who befriends and helps a dyslexic child. It opened to excellent responses from critics and audiences alike. Khan's performance was well-received, although he was particularly applauded for his directing.
In 2008, Khan appeared in the movie "Ghajini". The film was a major commercial success and became the highest grossing Bollywood movie of that year. For his performance in the film, Khan received several "Best Actor" nominations at various award ceremonies as well as his fifteenth Filmfare Best Actor nomination.
In 2009, Khan appeared in the commercially and critically acclaimed film "3 Idiots" as Ranchodas Chanchad w"3 Idiots" has become the highest-grossing Bollywood film of all time in India, breaking the previous record set by "Ghajini" which also starred Aamir Khan."3 Idiots" also became one of the few Indian films to become a major success in East Asian markets such as China, eventually bringing its overseas total to US $25 millionâ€”the highest-grossing Bollywood film of all time in overseas markets. It was expected to be the first Indian film to be officially released on YouTube, within 12 weeks of releasing in theatres on 25 March 2010, but finally got officially released on YouTube in May 2012. The film also went on to win many awards, winning six Filmfare Awards including best film and best director, ten Star Screen Awards and sixteen IIFA awards Around August 2011, Khan started talks with Siddhartha Basu's BIG Synergy, to host a talk show, similar to The Oprah Winfrey Show.

The film won numerous awards at several Indian award functions such as Filmfare and IIFA, and won the National Film Award for Most Popular Film, an award shared between Khan and the film's director, Ashutosh Gowariker.

Aamir was paid Rs. 3 crore rupees per episode to host the "Satyamev Jayate", and it makes him the highest paid host in Indian television industry (as on June 2012). Aamir, speaking on a radio channel, said that in view of phenomenal public response he may come up with a second season of the show. The show went live simultaneously on Star Plus, STAR World and national broadcaster Doordarshan on the 11Â am Sunday slot in eight languages, being the first to do so in India.
"Satyamev Jayte" opened to positive reviews and feedback from eminent personalities such as social activists, media houses, doctors, film and television personalities. Khan was also praised for his effort. In her review, Ritu Singh of IBN Live stated that, "Aamir Khan deserves an applause for bringing up such a sensitive issue and presenting it in a hard hitting way. The amount of research Aamir and his team has put into the show was clearly visible with the facts and figures presented. Every aspect of the issue was covered with great diligence." Parmita Uniyal from "Hindustan Times" praised the content and Khan for "step in to do what journalists are supposed to doÂ â€“ make a difference. The show is a classic example of that." Despite the initial hype and being labelled as the channel's most ambitious project till date, the initial viewership figures were not very encouraging; the show received an average television rating of 2.9 (with a reach of 14.4 million, it was watched by only 20% of TV viewers) in the six metros in its debut episode on 6 May. The rating was far lower than those of most other celebrity-hosted shows at the time.

In April 2006, Aamir participated in the demonstrations put up by the Narmada Bachao Andolan committee with their leader Medha Patkar after the Gujrat government's decision to raise the height of the Narmada dam. He quoted to support adivasis(tribes), who might be displaced from their homes. Later he faced protests and a partial ban on his film Fanaa but the Prime Minister of India, Manmohan Singh supported him by saying "Everyone has the freedom of expression. If someone says something on a particular subject, that doesn't mean you should start protesting." Aamir also lent his support to Janlokpal Bill Movement led by Anna Hazare in August 2011.
He has been supporting common causes and in the same row when asked about views on entertainment tax in 2012 budget Aamir said, "I don't want any reduction in that, all I expect is focus on education and nutrition." He quit the GOI's copyrights panels in February 2010 after facing sharp differences with other members. During the promotion of 3 Idiots he journeyed to diverse parts of India, mostly to small towns, noting that "film makers from Mumbai donâ€™t understand small town India".

In the media.
In a 2009 interview, Khan states that he tends to take an independent approach to the world of filmmaking, noting that he does not "do different things; I try to do it in a different manner. I think every person should follow his/her dream and try and make it possible to create an ability to achieve it backed by its practicality." He has also indicated that he is more interested in the process of filmmaking than in the end result: "For me, the process is more important, more joyful. I would like to have my entire concentration on the process right from the first step."
Aamir Khan has a reputation for shunning award ceremonies and not accepting any popular Indian film awards. Though nominated many times, Khan does not attend any Indian film award ceremony as he feels "Indian film awards lack credibility". When asked about the selection procedure and authenticity of popular Indian Film awards, Aamir Khan says, "fact is that I have no objections to film awards per se. I just feel that if I donâ€™t value a particular film award, then I wonâ€™t attend it either. Apart from the National Film Awards, I donâ€™t see any other award ceremony that I should give value to. My personal experience about these award ceremonies is that I donâ€™t trust them. I have no faith in them so I would prefer to stay away."
In 2007, Khan was invited to have a wax imitation of himself put on display at Madame Tussauds in London. However, Khan declined stating that, "It's not important to me... people will see my films if they want to. Also, I cannot deal with so many things, I have bandwidth only for that much."

In any right-angled triangle, the area of the square whose side is the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the areas of the squares whose sides are the two legs (the two sides that meet at a right angle).
where "c" represents the length of the hypotenuse, and "a" and "b" represent the lengths of the other two sides.
The Pythagorean theorem is named after the Greek mathematician Pythagoras ("ca." 570 BC—"ca." 495 BC), who by tradition is credited with its discovery and proof, although it is often argued that knowledge of the theorem predates him. There is evidence that Babylonian mathematicians understood the formula, although there is little surviving evidence that they used it in a mathematical framework.
The theorem has numerous proofs, possibly the most of any mathematical theorem. These are very diverse, including both geometric proofs and algebraic proofs, with some dating back thousands of years. The theorem can be generalized in various ways, including higher-dimensional spaces, to spaces that are not Euclidean, to objects that are not right triangles, and indeed, to objects that are not triangles at all, but "n"-dimensional solids. The Pythagorean theorem has attracted interest outside mathematics as a symbol of mathematical abstruseness, mystique, or intellectual power; popular references in literature, plays, musicals, songs, stamps and cartoons abound.
Other forms.
or
The Pythagorean equation relates the sides of a right triangle in a simple way, so that if the lengths of any two sides are known the length of the third side can be found. Another corollary of the theorem is that in any right triangle, the hypotenuse is greater than any one of the legs, but less than the sum of them.
A generalization of this theorem is the law of cosines, which allows the computation of the length of the third side of any triangle, given the lengths of two sides and the size of the angle between them. If the angle between the sides is a right angle, the law of cosines reduces to the Pythagorean equation.
Proofs.
This theorem may have more known proofs than any other (the law of quadratic reciprocity being another contender for that distinction); the book "The Pythagorean Proposition" contains 370 proofs.
Proof using similar triangles.
This proof is based on the proportionality of the sides of two similar triangles, that is, upon the fact that the ratio of any two corresponding sides of similar triangles is the same regardless of the size of the triangles.
The first result equates the cosine of each angle "θ" and the second result equates the sines.
Summing these two equalities, we obtain
The role of this proof in history is the subject of much speculation. The underlying question is why Euclid did not use this proof, but invented another. One conjecture is that the proof by similar triangles involved a theory of proportions, a topic not discussed until later in the "Elements", and that the theory of proportions needed further development at that time.
Euclid's proof.
In outline, here is how the proof in Euclid's "Elements" proceeds. The large square is divided into a left and right rectangle. A triangle is constructed that has half the area of the left rectangle. Then another triangle is constructed that has half the area of the square on the left-most side. These two triangles are shown to be congruent, proving this square has the same area as the left rectangle. This argument is followed by a similar version for the right rectangle and the remaining square. Putting the two rectangles together to reform the square on the hypotenuse, its area is the same as the sum of the area of the other two squares. The details are next.
Let "A", "B", "C" be the vertices of a right triangle, with a right angle at "A". Drop a perpendicular from "A" to the side opposite the hypotenuse in the square on the hypotenuse. That line divides the square on the hypotenuse into two rectangles, each having the same area as one of the two squares on the legs.
Next, each top square is related to a triangle congruent with another triangle related in turn to one of two rectangles making up the lower square.
This proof, which appears in Euclid's "Elements" as that of Proposition 47 in Book 1, demonstrates that the area of the square on the hypotenuse is the sum of the areas of the other two squares. This is quite distinct from the proof by similarity of triangles, which is conjectured to be the proof that Pythagoras used.
Proof by rearrangement.
The leftmost animation consists of a large square, side , containing four identical right triangles. The triangles are shown in two arrangements, the first of which leaves two squares "a"2 and "b"2 uncovered, the second of which leaves square "c"2 uncovered. The area encompassed by the outer square never changes, and the area of the four triangles is the same at the beginning and the end, so the black square areas must be equal, therefore 
A second proof is given by the middle animation. A large square is formed with area "c"2, from four identical right triangles with sides "a", "b" and "c", fitted around a small central square. Then two rectangles are formed with sides "a" and "b" by moving the triangles. Combining the smaller square with these rectangles produces two squares of areas "a"2 and "b"2, which must have the same area as the initial large square.
The third, rightmost image also gives a proof. The upper two squares are divided as shown by the blue and green shading, into pieces that when rearranged can be made to fit in the lower square on the hypotenuse – or conversely the large square can be divided as shown into pieces that fill the other two. This shows the area of the large square equals that of the two smaller ones.
Algebraic proofs.
The theorem can be proved algebraically using four copies of a right triangle with sides "a", "b" and "c", arranged inside a square with side "c" as in the top half of the diagram. The triangles are similar with area formula_10, while the small square has side and area . The area of the large square is therefore
But this is a square with side "c" and area "c"2, so
A similar proof uses four copies of the same triangle arranged symmetrically around a square with side "c", as shown in the lower part of the diagram. This results in a larger square, with side and area . The four triangles and the square side "c" must have the same area as the larger square,
giving
A related proof was published by former U.S. President James A. Garfield. Instead of a square it uses a trapezoid, which can be constructed from the square in the second of the above proofs by bisecting along a diagonal of the inner square, to give the trapezoid as shown in the diagram. The area of the trapezoid can be calculated to be half the area of the square, that is
The inner square is similarly halved, and there are only two triangles so the proof proceeds as above except for a factor of formula_16, which is removed by multiplying by two to give the result.
Proof using differentials.
One can arrive at the Pythagorean theorem by studying how changes in a side produce a change in the hypotenuse and employing calculus.
The triangle "ABC" is a right triangle, as shown in the upper part of the diagram, with "BC" the hypotenuse. At the same time the triangle lengths are measured as shown, with the hypotenuse of length "y", the side "AC" of length "x" and the side "AB" of length "a", as seen in the lower diagram part.
This is a differential equation which is solved to give
And the constant can be deduced from "x" = 0, "y" = "a" to give the equation
This is more of an intuitive proof than a formal one: it can be made more rigorous if proper limits are used in place of "dx" and "dy".
Converse.
For any three positive numbers "a", "b", and "c" such that , there exists a triangle with sides "a", "b" and "c", and every such triangle has a right angle between the sides of lengths "a" and "b".
For any triangle with sides "a", "b", "c", if then the angle between "a" and "b" measures 90°.
This converse also appears in Euclid's "Elements" (Book I, Proposition 48): 
Let "ABC" be a triangle with side lengths "a", "b", and "c", with Construct a second triangle with sides of length "a" and "b" containing a right angle. By the Pythagorean theorem, it follows that the hypotenuse of this triangle has length "c" = , the same as the hypotenuse of the first triangle. Since both triangles' sides are the same lengths "a", "b" and "c", the triangles are congruent and must have the same angles. Therefore, the angle between the side of lengths "a" and "b" in the original triangle is a right angle.
The above proof of the converse makes use of the Pythagorean Theorem itself. The converse can also be proven without assuming the Pythagorean Theorem.
where "α" is the angle opposite to side "a", "β" is the angle opposite to side "b", "γ" is the angle opposite to side "c", and sgn is the sign function.
Consequences and uses of the theorem.
Pythagorean triples.
A Pythagorean triple has three positive integers "a", "b", and "c", such that In other words, a Pythagorean triple represents the lengths of the sides of a right triangle where all three sides have integer lengths. Evidence from megalithic monuments in Northern Europe shows that such triples were known before the discovery of writing. Such a triple is commonly written Some well-known examples are and 
A primitive Pythagorean triple is one in which "a", "b" and "c" are coprime (the greatest common divisor of "a", "b" and "c" is 1).
Incommensurable lengths.
One of the consequences of the Pythagorean theorem is that line segments whose lengths are incommensurable (so the ratio of which is not a rational number) can be constructed using a straightedge and compass. Pythagoras' theorem enables construction of incommensurable lengths because the hypotenuse of a triangle is related to the sides by the square root operation.
The figure on the right shows how to construct line segments whose lengths are in the ratio of the square root of any positive integer. Each triangle has a side (labeled "1") that is the chosen unit for measurement. In each right triangle, Pythagoras' theorem establishes the length of the hypotenuse in terms of this unit. If a hypotenuse is related to the unit by the square root of a positive integer that is not a perfect square, it is a realization of a length incommensurable with the unit, such as , ,  . For more detail, see Quadratic irrational.
Incommensurable lengths conflicted with the Pythagorean school's concept of numbers as only whole numbers. The Pythagorean school dealt with proportions by comparison of integer multiples of a common subunit. According to one legend, Hippasus of Metapontum ("ca." 470 B.C.) was drowned at sea for making known the existence of the irrational or incommensurable.
Complex numbers.
For any complex number
the absolute value or modulus is given by
So the three quantities, "r", "x" and "y" are related by the Pythagorean equation,
Note that "r" is defined to be a positive number or zero but "x" and "y" can be negative as well as positive. Geometrically "r" is the distance of the "z" from zero or the origin "O" in the complex plane.
This can be generalised to find the distance between two points, "z"1 and "z"2 say. The required distance is given by
so again they are related by a version of the Pythagorean equation,
Euclidean distance in various coordinate systems.
The distance formula in Cartesian coordinates is derived from the Pythagorean theorem. If and are points in the plane, then the distance between them, also called the Euclidean distance, is given by
Pythagorean trigonometric identity.
where the last step applies Pythagoras' theorem. This relation between sine and cosine sometimes is called the fundamental Pythagorean trigonometric identity. In similar triangles, the ratios of the sides are the same regardless of the size of the triangles, and depend upon the angles. Consequently, in the figure, the triangle with hypotenuse of unit size has opposite side of size sin "θ" and adjacent side of size cos "θ" in units of the hypotenuse.
Relation to the cross product.
This can be seen from the definitions of the cross product and dot product, as
This can be considered as a condition on the cross product and so part of its definition, for example in seven dimensions.
Generalizations.
Similar figures on the three sides.
If one erects similar figures (see Euclidean geometry) with corresponding sides on the sides of a right triangle, then the sum of the areas of the ones on the two smaller sides equals the area of the one on the larger side.
This extension assumes that the sides of the original triangle are the corresponding sides of the three congruent figures (so the common ratios of sides between the similar figures are "a:b:c". While Euclid's proof only applied to convex polygons, the theorem also applies to concave polygons and even to similar figures that have curved boundaries (but still with part of a figure's boundary being the side of the original triangle). 
But, by the Pythagorean theorem, "a"2 + "b"2 = "c"2, so "A" + "B" = "C".
Conversely, if we can prove that "A" + "B" = "C" for three similar figures without using the Pythagorean theorem, then we can work backwards to construct a proof of the theorem. For example, the starting center triangle can be replicated and used as a triangle "C" on its hypotenuse, and two similar right triangles ("A" and "B" ) constructed on the other two sides, formed by dividing the central triangle by its altitude. The sum of the areas of the two smaller triangles therefore is that of the third, thus "A" + "B" = "C" and reversing the above logic leads to the Pythagorean theorem a2 + b2 = c2.
Law of cosines.
where θ is the angle between sides "a" and "b".
When θ is 90 degrees, then cos"θ" = 0, and the formula reduces to the usual Pythagorean theorem.
Arbitrary triangle.
[[File:Tâbit ibn Qorra.PNG|thumb|Generalization of Pythagoras' theorem by Tâbit ibn Qorra. Lower panel: reflection of triangle ABD (top) to form triangle DBA, similar to triangle ABC (top).]]
As the angle θ approaches π/2, the base of the isosceles triangle narrows, and lengths "r" and "s" overlap less and less. When θ = π/2, "ADB" becomes a right triangle, "r" + "s" = "c", and the original Pythagoras' theorem is regained.
One proof observes that triangle "ABC" has the same angles as triangle "ABD", but in opposite order. (The two triangles share the angle at vertex B, both contain the angle θ, and so also have the same third angle by the triangle postulate.) Consequently, "ABC" is similar to the reflection of "ABD", the triangle "DBA" in the lower panel. Taking the ratio of sides opposite and adjacent to θ,
Likewise, for the reflection of the other triangle,
the required result.
General triangles using parallelograms.
A further generalization applies to triangles that are not right triangles, using parallelograms on the three sides in place of squares. (Squares are a special case, of course.) The upper figure shows that for a scalene triangle, the area of the parallelogram on the longest side is the sum of the areas of the parallelograms on the other two sides, provided the parallelogram on the long side is constructed as indicated (the dimensions labeled with arrows are the same, and determine the sides of the bottom parallelogram). This replacement of squares with parallelograms bears a clear resemblance to the original Pythagoras' theorem, and was considered a generalization by Pappus of Alexandria in 4 A.D.
The lower figure shows the elements of the proof. Focus on the left side of the figure. The left green parallelogram has the same area as the left, blue portion of the bottom parallelogram because both have the same base "b" and height "h". However, the left green parallelogram also has the same area as the left green parallelogram of the upper figure, because they have the same base (the upper left side of the triangle) and the same height normal to that side of the triangle. Repeating the argument for the right side of the figure, the bottom parallelogram has the same area as the sum of the two green parallelograms.
Solid geometry.
This one-step formulation may be viewed as a generalization of Pythagoras' theorem to higher dimensions. However, this result is really just the repeated application of the original Pythagoras' theorem to a succession of right triangles in a sequence of orthogonal planes.
Inner product spaces.
The Pythagorean theorem can be generalized to inner product spaces, which are generalizations of the familiar 2-dimensional and 3-dimensional Euclidean spaces. For example, a function may be considered as a vector with infinitely many components in an inner product space, as in functional analysis.
In an inner product space, the concept of perpendicularity is replaced by the concept of orthogonality: two vectors v and w are orthogonal if their inner product formula_48 is zero. The inner product is a generalization of the dot product of vectors. The dot product is called the "standard" inner product or the "Euclidean" inner product. However, other inner products are possible.
In an inner-product space, the Pythagorean theorem states that for any two orthogonal vectors v and w we have
where the inner products of the cross terms are zero, because of orthogonality.
which says that twice the sum of the squares of the lengths of the sides of a parallelogram is the sum of the squares of the lengths of the diagonals. Any norm that satisfies this equality is "ipso facto" a norm corresponding to an inner product.
The Pythagorean identity can be extended to sums of more than two orthogonal vectors. If v"1", v"2", ..., v"n" are pairwise-orthogonal vectors in an inner-product space, then application of the Pythagorean theorem to successive pairs of these vectors (as described for 3-dimensions in the section on solid geometry) results in the equation
Parseval's identity is a further generalization that considers infinite sums of orthogonal vectors.
For the inner product
then is an orthogonal projection.
Non-Euclidean geometry.
The Pythagorean theorem is derived from the axioms of Euclidean geometry, and in fact, the Pythagorean theorem given above does not hold in a non-Euclidean geometry. (The Pythagorean theorem has been shown, in fact, to be equivalent to Euclid's Parallel (Fifth) Postulate.)
In other words, in non-Euclidean geometry, the relation between the sides of a triangle must necessarily take a non-Pythagorean form. For example, in spherical geometry, all three sides of the right triangle (say "a", "b", and "c") bounding an octant of the unit sphere have length equal to π/2, and all its angles are right angles, which violates the Pythagorean theorem because 
Here two cases of non-Euclidean geometry are considered—spherical geometry and hyperbolic plane geometry; in each case, as in the Euclidean case for non-right triangles, the result replacing the Pythagorean theorem follows from the appropriate law of cosines.
However, the Pythagorean theorem remains true in hyperbolic geometry and elliptic geometry if the condition that the triangle be right is replaced with the condition that two of the angles sum to the third, say "A"+"B" = "C". The sides are then related as follows: the sum of the areas of the circles with diameters "a" and "b" equals the area of the circle with diameter "c".
Spherical geometry.
where the higher order terms become negligibly small as "R" becomes large.
Hyperbolic geometry.
with γ the angle at the vertex opposite the side "c".
By using the Maclaurin series for the hyperbolic cosine, , it can be shown that as a hyperbolic triangle becomes very small (that is, as "a", "b", and "c" all approach zero), the hyperbolic relation for a right triangle approaches the form of Pythagoras' theorem.
History.
There is debate whether the Pythagorean theorem was discovered once, or many times in many places.
The history of the theorem can be divided into four parts: knowledge of Pythagorean triples, knowledge of the relationship among the sides of a right triangle, knowledge of the relationships among adjacent angles, and proofs of the theorem within some deductive system.
Bartel Leendert van der Waerden (1903–1996) conjectured that Pythagorean triples were discovered algebraically by the Babylonians. Written between 2000 and 1786 BC, the Middle Kingdom Egyptian papyrus "Berlin 6619" includes a problem whose solution is the Pythagorean triple 6:8:10, but the problem does not mention a triangle. The Mesopotamian tablet "Plimpton 322", written between 1790 and 1750 BC during the reign of Hammurabi the Great, contains many entries closely related to Pythagorean triples.
In India, the "Baudhayana Sulba Sutra", the dates of which are given variously as between the 8th century BC and the 2nd century BC, contains a list of Pythagorean triples discovered algebraically, a statement of the Pythagorean theorem, and a geometrical proof of the Pythagorean theorem for an isosceles right triangle.
The "Apastamba Sulba Sutra" ("ca." 600 BC) contains a numerical proof of the general Pythagorean theorem, using an area computation. Van der Waerden believed that "it was certainly based on earlier traditions". Boyer (1991) thinks the elements found in the "Śulba-sũtram" may be of Mesopotamian derivation.
With contents known much earlier, but in surviving texts dating from roughly the first century BC, the Chinese text "Zhou Bi Suan Jing" (周髀算经), ("The Arithmetical Classic of the Gnomon and the Circular Paths of Heaven") gives a reasoning for the Pythagorean theorem for the (3, 4, 5) triangle—in China it is called the "Gougu Theorem" (勾股定理). During the Han Dynasty (202 BC to 220 AD), Pythagorean triples appear in "The Nine Chapters on the Mathematical Art", together with a mention of right triangles. Some believe the theorem arose first in China, where it is alternatively known as the "Shang Gao Theorem" (商高定理), named after the Duke of Zhou's astronomer and mathematician, whose reasoning composed most of what was in the "Zhou Bi Suan Jing".
Pythagoras, whose dates are commonly given as 569–475 BC, used algebraic methods to construct Pythagorean triples, according to Proclus's commentary on Euclid. Proclus, however, wrote between 410 and 485 AD. According to Sir Thomas L. Heath (1861–1940), no specific attribution of the theorem to Pythagoras exists in the surviving Greek literature from the five centuries after Pythagoras lived. However, when authors such as Plutarch and Cicero attributed the theorem to Pythagoras, they did so in a way which suggests that the attribution was widely known and undoubted. "Whether this formula is rightly attributed to Pythagoras personally, [...] one can safely assume that it belongs to the very oldest period of Pythagorean mathematics."
Around 400 BC, according to Proclus, Plato gave a method for finding Pythagorean triples that combined algebra and geometry. Around 300 BC, in Euclid's "Elements", the oldest extant axiomatic proof of the theorem is presented.
In popular culture.
The Pythagorean theorem has arisen in popular culture in a variety of ways.

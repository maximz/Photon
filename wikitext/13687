Roman Polanski (born Rajmund Roman Thierry Polański; 1933) is a Polish-French film director, producer, writer and actor. Having made films in Poland, the United Kingdom, France and the United States, he is considered one of the few "truly international filmmakers." Polanski's films have inspired diverse directors, including the Coen brothers, Wes Anderson, David Fincher, Atom Egoyan, Darren Aronofsky, Park Chan-wook, Abel Ferrara, and Wes Craven.
Born in Paris to Polish parents, he moved with his family back to Poland (Second Polish Republic) in 1937, shortly before the outbreak of World War II. He survived the Holocaust and was educated in Poland (People's Republic of Poland) and became a director of both art house and commercial films. Polanski's first feature-length film, "Knife in the Water" (1962), made in Poland, was nominated for a United States Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film but was beaten by Federico Fellini's "8½". He has since received five more Oscar nominations, along with two Baftas, four Césars, a Golden Globe Award and the Palme d'Or of the Cannes Film Festival in France. In the United Kingdom he directed three films, beginning with "Repulsion" (1965). In 1968 he moved to the United States, and cemented his status by directing the horror film "Rosemary's Baby" (1968) for which Ruth Gordon won an Academy Award as Best Supporting Actress.
In 1969, Polanski's pregnant wife, Sharon Tate, was murdered by members of the Manson Family while staying at Polanski's Benedict Canyon home above Los Angeles. Following Tate's death, Polanski returned to Europe and spent much of his time in Paris and Gstaad, but did not direct another film until "Macbeth" (1971) in England. The following year he went to Italy to make "What?" (1973) and subsequently spent the next five years living near Rome. However, he travelled to Hollywood to direct "Chinatown" (1974). The film was nominated for eleven Academy Awards, was a critical and box-office success. Polanski's next film, "The Tenant" (1976), was shot in France, and completed the "Apartment Trilogy", following "Repulsion" and "Rosemary's Baby".
In 1977, after a photo shoot in Los Angeles, Polanski was arrested for the statutory rape of a 13-year-old girl and pleaded guilty to the charge of unlawful sex with a minor. To avoid sentencing, Polanski fled to his home in London, eventually settling in France. More than 32 years later, in September 2009, he was temporarily arrested by Swiss police at the request of U.S. authorities, who also asked for his extradition. The Swiss rejected that request, and instead released him from custody, declaring him a "free man." During an interview for a later film documentary, he offered his apology to the woman, and in a separate interview with Swiss TV he said that he has regretted that episode for the last 33 years.
Polanski continued to make films such as "The Pianist" (2002), a World War II true story drama about Jewish-Polish musician Władysław Szpilman. The film won three Academy Awards including Best Director, along with numerous international awards. He also directed other films, including "Oliver Twist" (2005), a story which parallels his own life as a "young boy attempting to triumph over adversity. His most recent films are "The Ghost Writer" (2010), a thriller focusing on a ghostwriter working with a former British Prime Minister, and "Carnage" (2011), a comedy-drama starring Jodie Foster and Kate Winslet.
Early life.
Polanski was born as Rajmund Roman Thierry Polański in Paris, France, the son of Bula and Ryszard Polański, a painter and manufacturer of sculptures, who had changed his family name from Liebling. His mother had a daughter, Annette, by her previous husband. Annette managed to survive Auschwitz, where her mother died, and left Poland forever for France. Polanski's Polish-born father was Jewish; Polanski's Russian-born mother had been raised Roman Catholic, and was of half Jewish ancestry. Polanski's parents were both agnostics.
World War II.
The Polański family moved back to the Polish city of Kraków in 1936, and were living there when World War II began with the invasion of Poland. Kraków was soon occupied by the German forces, and Nazi racial purity laws made the Polańskis targets of persecution, forcing them into the Kraków Ghetto, along with thousands of the city's Jews. Around the age of five, he attended primary school for only a few weeks, until "all the Jewish children were abruptly expelled," writes biographer Christopher Sandford. That initiative was soon followed by requiring all Jewish children over the age of twelve to wear white armbands with a blue Star of David imprinted for visual identification. After he was expelled, he would not be allowed to enter another classroom for the next six years.
His father was transferred, along with thousands of other Jews, to Mauthausen, a group of forty-nine German concentration camps in Austria. His mother was taken to Auschwitz and was killed soon after arriving. The mass forced exodus took place immediately after the German liquidation of the Krakow ghetto, after its failed rebellion, a true-life backdrop to Polanski's film, "The Pianist" (2002). Polanski, who was then in hiding from the Germans, remembered seeing his father being marched off with a long line of people. Polanski tried getting closer to his father to ask him what was happening, and managed to get within a few yards away. His father saw him, but afraid his son might be spotted by the German soldiers, whispered (in Polish,) "Get lost!"
Polański escaped the Kraków Ghetto in 1943 and survived by assuming the name Romek Wilk, with the help of some Polish Roman Catholic families who promised his father they would shelter him if necessary. Initially, that prearranged care-taking of young Polanski lasted only a few days, as the family complained that they "hadn't intended to give refuge to a 'little Jew'." The family evicted him, although they refused to return his suitcase of personal belongings.
As he roamed the countryside trying to survive in a Poland now occupied by German troops, he witnessed many horrors, such as being "forced to take part in a cruel and sadistic game in which German soldiers took shots at him for target practice." Author Ian Freer concludes that his constant childhood fears and dread of violence have contributed to the "tangible atmospheres he conjures up on film."
By the time the war ended in 1945, a fifth of the Polish population had been killed, with the vast majority of the victims being civilians. Of those deaths, 3 million were of Polish Jews, 90% of the country's Jewish population. Although his mother perished at Auschwitz, his father survived and was later reunited with his son. According to Sandford, Polanski would use his memory of his mother, her dress and makeup style, as a physical model for Faye Dunaway's character in his film "Chinatown" (1974).
Early career.
Polanski attended the National Film School in Łódź, the third-largest city in Poland. In the 1950s Polanski took up acting, appearing in Andrzej Wajda's "Pokolenie" ("A Generation", 1954) and in the same year in Silik Sternfeld's "Zaczarowany rower" ("Enchanted Bicycle" or "Magical Bicycle"). Polanski's directorial debut was also in 1955 with a short film "Rower" ("Bicycle"). "Rower" is a semi-autobiographical feature film, believed to be lost, which also starred Polanski. It refers to his real-life violent altercation with a notorious Kraków felon, Janusz Dziuba, who arranged to sell Polanski a bicycle, but instead beat him badly and stole his money. In real life the offender was arrested while fleeing after fracturing Polanski's skull, and executed for three murders, out of eight prior such assaults, which he had committed. Several other short films made during his study at Łódź gained him considerable recognition, particularly "Two Men and a Wardrobe" (1958) and "When Angels Fall" (1959). He graduated in 1959.
Film director.
1960s.
Polanski's first feature-length film, "Knife in the Water", was also the first significant Polish film after World War II that did not have a war theme. Scripted by Jerzy Skolimowski and Polanski, "Knife in the Water" is about a wealthy, unhappily married couple who decide to take a mysterious hitchhiker with them on a weekend boating excursion. A dark and unsettling work, Polanski's debut feature subtly evinces a profound pessimism about human relationships with regard to the psychological dynamics and moral consequences of status envy and sexual jealousy. "Knife in the Water" was a major commercial success in the West and gave Polanski an international reputation. The film also earned its director his first Academy Award nomination (Best Foreign Language Film, 1963). Leon Niemczyk, who played Andrzej, was the only professional actor in the film. Jolanta Umecka, who played Krystyna, was discovered by Polanski at a swimming pool.
Polanski left then-communist Poland and moved to France, where he had already made two notable short films in 1961: "The Fat and the Lean" and "Mammals". While in France, Polanski contributed one segment ("La rivière de diamants") to the French-produced omnibus film, "Les plus belles escroqueries du monde" (English title: "The Beautiful Swindlers") in 1964. However, Polanski found that in the early 1960s the French film industry was xenophobic and generally unwilling to support a rising filmmaker who was of foreign origin.
Polanski made three feature films in England, based on original scripts written by himself and Gérard Brach, a frequent collaborator. "Repulsion" (1965) is a psychological horror film focusing on a young Belgian woman named Carol (Catherine Deneuve), who is living in London with her older sister (Yvonne Furneaux). The film's themes, situations, visual motifs, and effects clearly reflect the influence of early surrealist cinema as well as horror movies of the 1950s – particularly Luis Buñuel's "Un chien Andalou", Jean Cocteau's "The Blood of a Poet", Henri-Georges Clouzot's "Diabolique" and Alfred Hitchcock's "Psycho".
"Cul-de-sac" (1966) is a bleak nihilist tragicomedy filmed on location in Northumberland. The general tone and the basic premise of the film owes a great deal to Samuel Beckett's "Waiting for Godot", along with aspects of Harold Pinter's "The Birthday Party".
"The Fearless Vampire Killers" (1967) (known by its original title, "Dance of the Vampires" in most countries outside the US) is a parody of vampire films. The plot concerns a buffoonish professor and his clumsy assistant, Alfred (played by Polanski), who are traveling through Transylvania in search of vampires. The ironic and macabre ending is considered classic Polanski. "The Fearless Vampire Killers" was Polanski's first feature to be photographed in color with the use of Panavision lenses, and included a striking visual style with snow-covered, fairy-tale landscapes, similar to the work of Soviet fantasy filmmakers. In addition, the richly textured color schemes of the settings evoke the magical, kaleidoscopic paintings of the great Belarussian-Jewish artist Marc Chagall, who provides the namesake for the innkeeper in the film. The film was written for Jack MacGowran, who played the lead role of Professor Abronsius.
Polanski met Sharon Tate while the film was being made, where she played the role of the local innkeeper's daughter. They were married in London on 1968.
Paramount studio head Robert Evans brought Polanski to America ostensibly to direct the film "Downhill Racer", but told Polanski that he really wanted to him to read the horror novel "Rosemary's Baby" by Ira Levin to see if a film could be made out of it. Polanski read it non-stop through the night and the following morning decided he wanted to write as well as direct it. He wrote the 272 page screenplay for the film in slightly longer than three weeks. The film, "Rosemary's Baby" (1968), was a box-office success and became his first Hollywood production, thereby establishing his reputation as a major commercial filmmaker. The film, a horror-thriller set in trendy Manhattan, is about Rosemary Woodhouse (Mia Farrow), a young housewife who is impregnated by the devil. Polanski's screenplay adaptation earned him a second Academy Award nomination.
On 9 August 1969, while Polanski was working in London, his wife, Sharon Tate, and four other people were murdered at the Polanskis' residence in Los Angeles.
1970s.
Polanski abandoned his project and did not resume working until the production of a film version of Shakespeare's "The Tragedy of Macbeth". Jon Finch and Francesca Annis played the main characters. He adapted Shakespeare's original text into a screenplay with the British National Theater literary manager and theater critic and Shakespeare expert Kenneth Tynan. Hugh Hefner and Playboy Productions funded the film, and it opened in New York and was screened in Playboy Theater. Hefner was also executive producer of the film and the film was listed as a "Playboy Production". The film was controversial because of Lady Macbeth's being nude in a scene., and received an X rating because of its graphic violence and nudity In his autobiography, Polanski wrote that he wanted to be true to the violent nature of the work, and that he had been aware that his first project following Tate's murder, would be subject to scrutiny and probable cricitism regardless of the subject matter; if he had made a comedy he would have been perceived as callous.
Written by Polanski and previous collaborator Gérard Brach, "What?" (1973) is a mordant absurdist comedy loosely based on the themes of "Alice in Wonderland" and Henry James. The film is a rambling shaggy dog story about the sexual indignities that befall a winsome young American hippie woman hitchhiking through Europe.
Polanski returned to Hollywood in 1973 to direct "Chinatown" for Paramount Pictures. The film was nominated for 11 Academy Awards. The stars, Jack Nicholson and Faye Dunaway, both received Oscar nominations for their roles, and the script by Robert Towne won for Best Original Screenplay. Polanski appears in a cameo role.
Polanski returned to Paris for his next film, "The Tenant" (1976), which was based on a 1964 novel by Roland Topor, a French writer of Polish-Jewish origin. In addition to directing the film, Polanski also played a leading role of a timid Polish immigrant living in Paris. Together with his two earlier works, "The Tenant" can be seen as the third installment in a loose trilogy of films called the "Apartment Trilogy" that explore the themes of social alienation and psychic and emotional breakdown. In his autobiography, Polanski wrote: "I had a great admiration for American institutions and regarded the United States as the only truly democratic country in the world."
He dedicated his next film, "Tess" (1979), to the memory of his late wife, Sharon Tate. It was Tate who suggested to Polanski that he read it, as she felt it might make a good film. "Tess" was Polanski's first film since his 1977 arrest in Los Angeles, and because of the American-British extradition treaty, "Tess" was shot in the north of France instead of Hardy's England. Nastassja Kinski appeared in the title role opposite Peter Firth and Leigh Lawson.
The film became the most expensive made in France up to that time. Ultimately, "Tess" proved a financial success and was well received by both critics and the public. For "Tess", Polanski won France's César Awards for Best Picture and Best Director and received his fourth Academy Award nomination (and his second nomination for Best Director). The film received three Oscars: best cinematography, best art direction and best costume design. In addition, "Tess" was nominated for best picture.
1980s.
In 1981, Polanski directed and co-starred (as Mozart) in a stage production of Peter Shaffer's play "Amadeus", first in Warsaw, then in Paris. The play was again directed by Polanski, in Milan, in 1999.
Nearly seven years passed before Polanski's next film, "Pirates", a lavish period piece starring Walter Matthau as Captain Red, which the director intended as an homage to the beloved Errol Flynn swashbucklers of his childhood. Captain Red's henchman, Jean Baptiste, was played by Cris Campion. The film is about a rebellion the two lead on a ship called the "Neptune", in the seventeenth century. The screenplay was written by Polanski, Gerard Brach, and John Brownjohn. The film was shot on location in Tunisia, using a full sized pirate vessel constructed for the production. It was a financial and critical failure despite the fact that a lot of money had been spent on it. However, it was nominated for an Academy Award because of the costumes Anthony Powell made for it, which were viewed as beautiful.
"Frantic" (1988) was Hitchcockian suspense-thriller starring Harrison Ford and the actress/model Emmanuelle Seigner, who later became Polanski's wife. The film follows an ordinary tourist in Paris whose wife is kidnapped. He attempts, hopelessly, to go through the Byzantine bureaucratic channels to deal with her disappearance, but finally takes matters into his own hands.
1990s.
Polanski followed this with the dark psycho-sexual film "Bitter Moon" (1992), followed by a film of the acclaimed play "Death and the Maiden" (1994) starring Sigourney Weaver.
"The Ninth Gate" is a thriller based on the novel "El Club Dumas" by Arturo Perez-Reverte and starring Johnny Depp. The movie's plot is based on the idea that an ancient text called "The Nine Gates of the Kingdom of Shadow", authored by Aristide Torchia along with Lucifer, are the key to raising Satan.
In 1997, Polanski directed a stage version of his 1967 film "The Fearless Vampire Killers", which debuted in Vienna followed by successful runs in Stuttgart, Hamburg, Berlin, and Budapest. On 1998, Polanski was elected a member of the Académie des Beaux-Arts.
2000s.
In 2001, Polanski filmed "The Pianist", an adaptation of the World War II autobiography of the same name by Polish-Jewish musician Władysław Szpilman. Szpilman's experiences as a persecuted Jew in Poland during World War II were reminiscent of Polanski and his family. While Szpilman and Polanski escaped the concentration camps, their families did not, eventually perishing.
When Warsaw, Poland was chosen for the 2002 premiere of "The Pianist", "the country exploded with pride." According to reports, numerous former communists came to the screening and "agreed that it was a fantastic film."
In May 2002, the film won the "Palme d'Or" (Golden Palm) award at the Cannes Film Festival, as well as Césars for Best Film and Best Director, and later the 2002 Academy Award for Directing. Because he would have been arrested once in the United States, Polanski did not attend the Academy Awards ceremony in Hollywood. After the announcement of the Best Director Award, Polanski received a standing ovation from most of those present in the theater. Actor Harrison Ford accepted the award for Polanski, and then presented the Oscar to him at the Deauville Film Festival five months later in a public ceremony. Polanski later received the Crystal Globe award for outstanding artistic contribution to world cinema at the Karlovy Vary International Film Festival in 2004.
"Oliver Twist" is an adaptation of Dickens's classic, written by "The Pianist"'s Ronald Harwood and shot in Prague. Polanski said in interviews that he made the film as something he could show his children, and that the life of the young scavenger mirrored his own life, fending for himself in World War II Poland.
2010s.
"The Ghost Writer", a thriller focusing on a ghostwriter working on the memoirs of a character based loosely on former British prime minister Tony Blair, swept the European Film Awards in 2010, winning six awards, including best movie, director, actor and screenplay. When it premiered at the 60th Berlinale in February 2010, Polanski won a Silver Bear for Best Director, and in February 2011, it won four César Awards, France’s version of the Academy Awards.
The cast includes Ewan McGregor as the writer and Pierce Brosnan as former British Prime Minister Adam Lang. The film was shot on locations in Germany.
In the U.S., film critic Roger Ebert included it in his top 10 pick for 2010, and states that "this movie is the work of a man who knows how to direct a thriller. Smooth, calm, confident, it builds suspense instead of depending on shock and action. " Co-star Ewan McGregor agrees, saying about Polanski that "he's a legend. . . I've never examined a director and the way that they work, so much before. He's brilliant, just brilliant, and absolutely warrants his reputation as a great director."
Polanski shot "Carnage" in February/March 2011. The film is a screen version of Yasmina Reza’s play "God of Carnage", a comedy about the relationship between two couples after their children get in a fight at school and the selfishness of everyone, which eventually leads to chaos. It stars Kate Winslet, Jodie Foster, Christoph Waltz and John C. Reilly. Though set in New York, it was shot in Paris due to Polanski's legal inability to travel to the US. The film had its world premiere on 9 September 2011 at the Venice Film Festival and was released in the US by Sony Pictures Classics on 16 December 2011.
Co-stars Jodie Foster and Kate Winslet commented about Polanski's directing style. According to Foster, "He has a very, very definitive style about how he likes it done. He decides everything. He decided every lens. Every prop. Everything. It’s all him." Winslet adds that "Roman is one of the most extraordinary men I’ve ever met. The guy is 77 years old. He has an effervescent quality to him. He’s very joyful about his work, which is infectious. He likes to have a small crew, to the point that, when I walked on the set, my thought was, ‘My God, this is it?’” Also noting that style of directing, New York Film Festival director Richard Pena, during the American premier of the film, called Polanski "a poet of small spaces . . . in just a couple of rooms he can conjure up an entire world, an entire society."
He is currently in post-production on a film adaptation of the award-winning play "Venus in Fur", starring his wife Emmanuelle Seigner and Mathieu Amalric. Polanski worked with the play's author, David Ives on the screenplay. The film is being shot in French and is Polanski's first non-English language feature film in forty years. 
Immediately after "Venus in Fur", Polanski is preparing to shoot "D", a film about the notorious Dreyfus Affair in the 19th century, in which one of the few Jewish members of the French Army's general staff was wrongly convicted of passing military secrets to Germany and sent to Devil's Island, only to finally be acquitted 12 years later. The film is written by Robert Harris, who is working with Polanski for the third time after "The Ghost Writer" and their abortive "Pompeii", which was cancelled just before production in 2007.
Marriages and relationships.
Barbara Lass.
Polanski's first wife, Barbara Lass (née Kwiatkowska), was a Polish actress who also starred in Polanski's 1959 "When Angels Fall". The couple were married in 1959 and divorced in 1961. 
Sharon Tate.
He met rising actress Sharon Tate while filming "The Fearless Vampire Killers", and during the production the two of them began dating. On 1968, Polanski married Tate in London. In his autobiography, Polanski described his brief time with Tate as the best years of his life.
In August 1969, a year and a half after their marriage, while Polanski was in Europe working on a film, she was murdered along with four of their friends at their home in Los Angeles by members of Charles Manson's "family," a group of young, gullible, and mostly female followers. Tate was pregnant at the time of her murder.
Manson, along with members of his "family" were arrested in late 1969, and eventually tried and found guilty in 1971 of 27 counts, including first-degree murder, an event now called the Manson murders. Because at the time it was one of the most "horrific crimes in modern history," the crime and trial of Manson and his followers became a media sensation, leading to movies, documentaries and bestselling books.
Polanski has said that his absence on the night of the murders is the greatest regret of his life. In his autobiography, he wrote, "Sharon's death is the only watershed in my life that really matters", and commented that her murder changed his personality from a "boundless, untroubled sea of expectations and optimism" to one of "ingrained pessimism ... eternal dissatisfaction with life".
Among the media-generated sensationalism were rumors that claimed Tate and her visitors were taking drugs, despite the coroner announcing that no traces of drugs or nicotine were found after Tate's autopsy. For years afterward, notes Sandford, "reporters openly speculated about the Polanskis' home life" and their personalities in order to create more media gossip about the private lives of Hollywood celebrities.
Nastassja Kinski.
In 1976, Polanski started a romantic relationship with Nastassja Kinski, who starred in "Tess". She was between 15 and 17 years old, and he was 43. Their relationship ended at the completion of filming. In an interview with David Letterman in 1982, she described their relationship and gave her opinion about his sexual assault case, claiming it was "ridiculous" and his residence in France was "a loss for America."
Emmanuelle Seigner.
In 1989, Polanski married French actress Emmanuelle Seigner, 33 years his junior. They have two children, daughter Morgane and son Elvis. Polanski and his children speak Polish at home.
Legal history.
Sexual abuse case.
On 11 March 1977, Polanski, then 43 years old, was arrested in Los Angeles for the sexual assault of 13-year-old Samantha Geimer during a photo shoot for French "Vogue" magazine. Polanski was indicted on six counts of criminal behavior, including rape. At his arraignment he pled not guilty to all charges.
Geimer's attorney next arranged a plea bargain in which five of the six charges would be dismissed and Polanski accepted. Because Polanski fled the country before final sentencing, the charges were not dismissed and still remain pending.
As a result of the plea bargain, Polanski pled guilty to the charge of "Unlawful Sexual Intercourse with a minor," and was ordered to undergo 90 days of psychiatric evaluation at Chino State Prison. On release from prison after 42 days, Polanski understood that at the final sentencing he would be put on probation. However, he learned that the judge was planning to renege on his promise of no further jail time, and might even deport him. Polanski's attorney suggested that despite the fact that the prosecuting attorneys recommended probation, "the judge could no longer be trusted . . ." and the judge's representations were "worthless."
Upon learning of the judge's plans, Polanski fled to France on 1 February 1978, just hours before sentencing. As a French citizen, he has been protected from extradition and has lived mostly in France since then.
In an interview with Larry King, Geimer said that the police and media had been slow at the time of the assault to believe her account, which she attributed to the climate of the era. In 1988 she sued Polanski. Among other things, the suit alleged sexual assault, false imprisonment, seduction of a minor, and intentional infliction of emotional distress. In 1993 Polanski agreed to settle with Geimer. In August 1996 Polanski still owed her $604,416; Geimer and her lawyers later confirmed that the settlement was completed.
On 26 September 2009, Polanski was arrested while in Switzerland at the request of U.S. authorities. The arrest brought renewed attention to the case and stirred controversy, particularly in the U.S. and Europe. Polanski was defended by many prominent individuals, including Hollywood celebrities and European artists and politicians, who called for his release. American public opinion was reported to run against him, however, and polls in France and Poland showed strong majorities favored his extradition to the U.S.
Polanski was kept in jail near Zurich for two months, then put under house arrest at his home in Gstaad while awaiting decision of appeals fighting extradition. On 12 July 2010 the Swiss rejected the U.S. request, declared him a "free man" and released him from custody.
During a television interview on 10 March 2011, Geimer blamed the media, reporters, the court, and the judge for causing "way more damage to and her family than anything Roman Polanski has ever done," and stated that the judge was using her and a noted celebrity for his own personal gain from the media exposure. 
Documentary films.
In 2008 the documentary film, "", was released in Europe and the U.S. where it won numerous awards. The film focuses on the judge in the case and the possible reasons why he changed his mind. It includes interviews with people involved in the case, including the victim, Geimer, and the prosecutor, Roger Gunson. Geimer said that the judge "didn't care what happened" to her or Polanski, but "was orchestrating some little show," while Gunson added, "I'm not surprised that Polanski left under those circumstances, . . . it was going to be a real circus."
Former DA David Wells, whose statements were the most damning against Polanski, and who said he advised the judge to imprison Polanski, admitted that he lied about those statements, and said that to the press to "play up" his own role.
In December 2009, a California appellate court discussed the film's allegations as it denied Polanski's request to have the case dismissed. While saying they "deeply concerned" the court, and were "in many cases supported by considerable evidence," it also found that “(e)ven in light of our fundamental concern about the misconduct. . . flight was not Polanski’s only option. It was not even his best option." It said dismissal of the case, which would erase Polanski's guilty plea, wouldn't be an "appropriate result," and that he still had other legal options.
In September 2011, the documentary film "", had its world premiere in Zurich, Switzerland. During an interview in the film, he offers his apology to Geimer: "She is a double victim: My victim, and a victim of the press."
"Vanity Fair" libel case.
In 2004, Polanski sued "Vanity Fair" magazine in London for libel. A 2002 article in the magazine claimed that Polanski made sexual advances towards a young model while travelling to Tate's funeral. The trial included testimony of film producer Prudence Farrow and others, and it was concluded from the evidence that the event could not have happened. Polanski was awarded £50,000 in damages by the High Court in London.

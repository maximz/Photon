Sam & Cat is an American television comedy series planned for Nickelodeon. It is a crossover spin-off of both "iCarly" and "Victorious", starring Jennette McCurdy as Sam Puckett (from "iCarly") and Ariana Grande as Cat Valentine (from "Victorious"). The series will be about these two girls as they buddy up as roommates and start a babysitting business to fund their adventures.
Production.
On August 3, 2012, Nickelodeon announced that Dan Schneider, the creator of "iCarly" and "Victorious", would be making a pilot for a spin off of both shows called "Sam & Cat". The pilot was ordered in August 2012. The series was picked up for 20 episodes on November 29, 2012, with the show planned to premiere in 2013. The series began production in January 2013.
Plot.
The pilot suggests they will be roommates who launch a babysitting business for income. The television program will show all the journeys that both characters experience. Supposedly, Sam travels from Seattle (where "iCarly" was set) to speak about the web show at Hollywood Arts, the setting for "Victorious". There she and Cat meet up and eventually become friends and roommates and partners in a babysitting business.
Release.
The series is planned to premiere on Nickelodeon in the United States sometime in 2013. It was announced in January 2013 that Dan Schneider was aiming for March 23, 2013, along with the 2013 Kids' Choice Awards, as the premiere date for the show.

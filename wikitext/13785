Etymology.
The Brown-Driver-Briggs Lexicon gives the meaning of Nephilim as "giants". Robert Baker Girdlestone argued the word comes from the Hiphil causative stem. Adam Clarke took it as passive, "fallen", "apostates". Ronald Hendel states that it is a passive form "ones who have fallen", equivalent grammatically to "paqid" "one who is appointed" (i.e. overseer), "asir", "one who is bound", (i.e. prisoner) etc.

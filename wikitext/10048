The PlayStation 4 (also known as PS4) is an upcoming video game console and will be the fourth home video game console produced by Sony Computer Entertainment and the successor to the PlayStation 3 as part of the PlayStation series. The PlayStation 4 will compete with Nintendo's Wii U, and any other as yet unannounced consoles, as part of the eighth generation of video game consoles. The console was confirmed at a press conference on February 20, 2013, with a release date set for Q4 2013.
History.
According to lead system architect Mark Cerny, development on Sony's eighth-generation PlayStation 4 (PS4) began as early as 2008. Less than two years earlier, the PlayStation 3 had officially launched after months of delays due to issues in production. The delay placed Sony almost a year behind Microsoft's Xbox 360, which was already approaching 10 million units sold by the time the PS3 launched. PlayStation Europe CEO Jim Ryan said Sony wanted to avoid repeating the same mistake with PS3's successor.
In early 2013, Sony announced that an event known as PlayStation Meeting 2013 would be held in New York on February 20, 2013, to cover the "future of PlayStation". Sony officially announced the PlayStation 4 at the event. They revealed details about the PS4's hardware and discussed some of the new features it will introduce. Sony also showed off real-time footage of games in development, as well as some technical demonstrations. They expect to release the console in the fourth quarter of 2013.
Hardware.
The design of the console has not yet been revealed, because the design and specifications are still being finalized. However, partial technical specifications about the console have been announced. Eurogamer believes that the PlayStation 4 will be "the most technologically advanced games console of the next gaming era."
Console.
The PlayStation 4 will feature a semi-custom single-chip processor (APU) developed by AMD in coordination with Sony. It consists of an integrated CPU and GPU. The Sony PlayStation 4 system-on-chip integrates eight AMD x86 Jaguar cores, a custom AMD Radeon HD core, various special-purpose hardware blocks, as well as a multi-channel GDDR5 memory controller. The technologies found in the PlayStation 4 will be relatively similar to those in personal computers, which will probably make it easier and less expensive for developers to make games for the PlayStation 4, since the architecture will be more familiar.
The central processing unit (CPU) will have eight x86-64 cores based on the upcoming Jaguar CPU architecture. This processor marks a change from the "powerful but difficult to develop for" Cell processor found in the PlayStation 3. 
The graphics processing unit (GPU) will consist of 18 compute units based on GCN (Graphics Core Next) for a total of 1152 stream processors, resulting in a theoretical peak performance of 1.84 TFLOP/s. This computing power can be used for graphics, simulation, or a combination thereof. The GPU will also include dedicated graphics technology for seamless compression and decompression of video media. Eurogamer calls the graphics technology in the PlayStation 4 "impressive" and an improvement from the difficulties developers experienced on the PlayStation 3.
The PlayStation 4 will contain 8 GB of GDDR5 unified system memory, allowing for 176 GB/s of bandwidth. 16 times the system RAM found in the PlayStation 3, this amount of RAM is said to be welcome for developers and is expected to give the console considerable longevity. The unified memory architecture allows the CPU and GPU to access a consolidated memory, removing the requirement for separate dedicated CPU and GPU memories. The split architecture on the PlayStation 3 was said to have proven problematic. The RAM choices are said to have added significantly to the PlayStation 4's bill of materials.
The read-only optical drive will read Blu-ray discs at 6x (marking an upgrade from 2x speeds found on the PlayStation 3) and DVDs at 8x. Eurogamer believes that the Blu-ray drive will be dual-layer (capable of reading 50GB discs) and not quad-layer (capable of reading 100GB discs). A hard disk drive will be included, although Sony has not yet announced the size.
The PlayStation 4 will feature 802.11 b/g/n network connectivity as well as Ethernet. An unknown number of USB 3.0 ports will be included, as will Bluetooth 2.1. An auxiliary port will also be included for connection to the Playstation Eye. The system will come bundled with a mono headset, which can be plugged into the DualShock 4. Output options will be HDMI, analog AV-out, and optical S/PDIF audio out. The console will support 4K resolution output for photos and videos but games can not be rendered at that resolution. Eurogamer believes that 1080p will be the standard resolution for PlayStation 4 games.
The console will also include a secondary custom chip which will handle downloading, uploading and social features. This chip will allow the system to seamlessly download games in the background, even when the main system is powered off (standby mode).
Controllers.
The DualShock 4 will be the PlayStation 4's main controller. It is similar to the DualShock 3, connecting to the console via Bluetooth 2.1+EDR. The DualShock 3 will not, however, be compatible with PlayStation 4. The DualShock 4 will be equipped with several new features, including a built-in two-point capacitative touch pad on the front of the controller, which can be clicked. The controller will support motion detection via a three-axis gyroscope and three-axis accelerometer and improved vibration. It will include a non-removable, rechargeable lithium-ion battery tentatively capable of storing 1000 mAh. The tentative design weighs , has dimensions of , and has a rubber or etched plastic backing to enhance grip. The design shown at the PlayStation 4 reveal event was "near final." However, the DualShock 4 will not be demoed until around E3 2013.
The controller features several output connectors. A stereo jack (3.5 mm TRS connector) will allow the connection of a headset to allow a user to speak and hear audio simultaneously. A micro USB port and an extension port are also included. It can be charged via microUSB, a dedicated charging station, or the console (even when the console is off). It will include a mono speaker.
The DualShock 4 features the following buttons: PS button, SHARE button, OPTIONS button, d-pad, action buttons (triangle, circle, cross, square), shoulder buttons (R1/L1), triggers (R2/L2), analog stick click buttons (L3/R3) and a touch pad click button. These mark several changes from the DualShock 3 and other previous PlayStation controllers. The START and SELECT buttons have been merged into a single OPTIONS button. A dedicated SHARE button will allow players to upload video from their gameplay experiences. The joysticks and triggers have been redesigned based on developer input. The joysticks will now feature a concave surface, similar to that of the Xbox 360 controller.
The DualShock 4 will also feature a light bar that can display different colors. These colors will indicate which player is which, and alert the player to critical messages such as low health. It will also interact with the camera attachment; the external camera attachment perceives movement and depth by using the controller's light bar, based on the existing technology used in the PlayStation Move. The PlayStation 4 will also offer support for the existing PlayStation Move controller.
PlayStation 4 Eye.
The PlayStation Eye has been redesigned. It will include two 1280×800px cameras. The lenses will operate with an aperture of f/2.0, with 30 cm focusing distance, and an 85° field of view. The dual camera setup will allow for different modes of operation, depending on the target application. The two cameras can be used together for depth-sensing of objects in its field of vision, akin to the Microsoft Kinect. Alternatively, one of the cameras can be used for generating the video image, with the other used for motion tracking.
The PlayStation Eye will also feature a four-channel microphone array, which will help cut out unwanted background noise and may even be used to issue commands. It is tentatively set to be (width × height × depth), with a weight of . It will record video in RAW and YUV (uncompressed) formats. It will connect with the PlayStation 4 via the console's auxiliary port.
The PlayStation Eye will ship as part of the console, rather than being a separate accessory.
Companion devices.
Sony will allow a variety of second screen devices to interact with the PlayStation 4. Companion devices (smartphones, tablets, and the PlayStation Vita) will be able to wake up the PlayStation 4 console.
PlayStation Vita.
The PlayStation Vita can be used as a second screen device for streaming video directly from the console to the PlayStation Vita. Where supported, this allows a game to be played remotely. Sony hopes to make most PlayStation 4 games playable on the PlayStation Vita. Developers will be able to add Vita-specific controls for use via Remote Play.
PlayStation App.
Sony has implemented features for using a tablet, smartphone, or other mobile device to interact with the PlayStation Network. This is similar to the Xbox SmartGlass for Xbox 360.
A PlayStation app will allow certain functionality on mobile devices. It will be available for iPhone, iPad, and Android devices. Gamers can use this application to purchase PlayStation 4 titles and have them downloaded to the console, watch live streams of games, and view maps from PlayStation 4 titles.
Software and services.
Sony hopes to make the PlayStation 4 more simple and immediate. Sony hopes to evolve the services it offers over the PlayStation 4's lifespan. The PlayStation Network will allow players access to a variety of services, from the PlayStation Store to Music Unlimited and Video Unlimited. Gamers can use their real name so their friends know who they are, in addition to a moniker for online gaming where anonymity is important. Customers can browse titles on the PlayStation Store and stream games via Gaikai to try them out nearly instantly. The PlayStation 4 will not require an always-on Internet connection. Sony has not yet announced the fate of PlayStation Plus on the PlayStation 4.
The user interface has been completely revamped from the XrossMediaBar on the PlayStation 3. The design is said to be similar to the new PlayStation Store user interface on the PlayStation 3.
The PlayStation 4 will feature several services from third-party vendors, such as Netflix and Amazon Instant Video. It will be possible to load up applications such as a Web browser while playing a game.
Social features.
"Social" was one of the five major principles Sony talked about at the PlayStation 4 announcement. While the console will feature social functionality, people who do not want to connect with others need not use those features.
The DualShock 4 controller includes a SHARE button. Pressing this button allows the player to cycle through the last several minutes of gameplay to select a clip appropriate for sharing. Video can be uploaded directly from the console, either to websites, or another PlayStation Network user.
Gamers can live stream their games via services such as Ustream. Friends can comment and help out.
The PlayStation 4 home screen will include personalized content from friends.
Games.
Sony Computer Entertainment of America chief executive officer Jack Tretton has stated that games for the PlayStation 4 will range in price from US$0.99 to $60.00, not marking a price increase from the current generation.
Sony hopes to make it easier for independent game developers to develop titles for the PlayStation 4, although all developers will still be required to purchase a development kit in order to publish on the platform.
Downloadable content.
The system will feature downloadable content including complete games, similar to what's available on the PlayStation Portable, PlayStation Vita and PlayStation 3. All PlayStation 4 retail games will be downloadable. When a game is purchased, only a portion has to be dowloaded before it can be played. The remaining part will download during gameplay. This is accomplished via the system's secondary background processor.
The PlayStation 4 will feature technology that attempts to determine games a player is likely to purchase next, and then automatically downloads those titles in the background in an effort to save time.
Backward compatibility.
The PlayStation 4 hardware will not include the ability to "natively" play PlayStation 3 titles. This is a consequence of moving away from the Cell architecture of the PlayStation 3 in favor of x86-64 for the PlayStation 4.
The PlayStation 4 will also not natively support PlayStation Network titles. Sony is considering emulation or cloud options for PlayStation Network games, although with regards to native support, Sony Worldwide Studios head Shuhei Yoshida said "But native support, no, sorry."
There is a plan to launch a cloud-based streaming service via Gaikai, a company purchased by Sony, which will render PlayStation, PlayStation 2 and PlayStation 3 games and stream them to the PlayStation 4.
Trophies.
Although trophies were not mentioned at the Future of PlayStation conference, the PS4's user interface confirms that games on the console will support them. The PS4 will have an improved User Profile for players, showing recent activity, their full name and other details in addition to their unlocked trophies.
Used games.
Eurogamer's Tom Bramwell met with Shuhei Yoshida after the PlayStation Meeting 2013 conference and inquired if the PS4 would be able to play used games. Yoshida responded to the question: "Yes. That's the general expectation by consumers - they purchase physical form, they want to use it everywhere, right? So that's my expectation." This approach could provide a point of differentiation with the successor to the Xbox 360.
In development.
Games expected to launch with the PlayStation 4 include "" and "Watch Dogs". Joystiq believes that "DriveClub" may also make the launch. 
Some publishers have indicated that they are developing titles for the PlayStation 4 without explicitly stating what those titles would be. Joystiq has compiled a number of such companies. Sony claims to have "every" significant third party developer developing for the PlayStation 4.

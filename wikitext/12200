WWE is an American based professional wrestling promotion based in Stamford, Connecticut. WWE personnel consist of professional wrestlers, managers, play-by-play and color commentators, ring announcers, interviewers, referees, trainers, producers, script writers and various other positions. Executives and board of directors are also listed.
WWE contracts range from developmental contracts to multi-year deals. Most personnel are independent contractors. Personnel on the main roster appear on "Raw", "SmackDown", "Main Event", "Superstars" and "Saturday Morning Slam" (WWE's primary weekly television programming), on pay-per-views and at live events. Developmental personnel from NXT Wrestling appear on "NXT" (personnel on the main roster occasionally do as well).
Personnel are organized below by their role in WWE. Their ring name is on the left, and their real name is on the right. If someone is inactive for any reason, due to injury, suspension, not appearing in more than 30 days or otherwise, that information is noted. WWE refers to its male performers as "Superstars" and its female performers as "Divas". The term "Superstars" is also occasionally used to refer to all WWE performers, regardless of gender.

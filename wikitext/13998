Capricorn () is the tenth astrological sign in the Zodiac, originating from the constellation of Capricornus. It spans the 270-300th degree of the zodiac, between 270 and 305.25 degree of celestial longitude. In astrology, Capricorn is considered an introvert sign, an earth sign, and one of the four cardinal signs. Capricorn is ruled by the planet Saturn. In the Tropical zodiac, the Sun transits this area of the zodiac from December 22 to January 20 each year. In Sidereal astrology, the sun currently transits the constellation of Capricorn from January 15 - February 14 (approximately).
Mythology.
The constellation is usually depicted as a goat with a fish's tail (see "Hippocamp"). One myth says that when the goat-god Pan was attacked by Typhoon , he dove into the Nile; the parts above the water remained a goat, but those under the water transformed into a fish. 
Capricorn is sometimes depicted as a sea-goat, and sometimes as a terrestrial goat. The reasons for this are unknown, but the image of a sea-goat goes back at least to Babylonian times. Furthermore, the Sumerian god Enki's symbols included a goat and a fish, which later combined into a single beast, the goat Capricorn, recognized as the Zodiacal constellation Capricornus.

On the other hand, the constellation of Capricornus is sometimes identified as Amalthea, the goat that suckled the infant Zeus after his mother Rhea saved him from being devoured by his father Cronos (in Greek mythology). The goat's broken horn was transformed into the cornucopia or horn of plenty. Some ancient sources claim that this derives from the sun "taking nourishment" while in the constellation, in preparation for its climb back northward. As such, it is a symbol of discipline.
Associations.
In astrology, a planet's domicile is the zodiac sign over which it has rulership. The planet said to be ruler of Capricorn is Saturn.

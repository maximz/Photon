Drew Blyth Barrymore (born February 22, 1975) is an American actress, film director, screenwriter, producer, and model. She is a descendant of the Drew family and Barrymore family of iconic American stage and cinema actors, and she is the granddaughter of film legend John Barrymore. She first appeared in an advertisement when she was 11 months old. Barrymore made her film debut in "Altered States" in 1980. Afterwards, she starred in her breakout role in Steven Spielberg's "E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial", and endeared herself to film audiences of every generation in her role as little sister Gertie, who was shocked into screaming together with E.T. in the bedroom closet. She quickly became one of Hollywood's most recognized child actresses, going on to establish herself in mainly comic roles.
Following a turbulent childhood which was marked by recurring drug and alcohol abuse and two stints in rehab, Barrymore wrote the 1990 autobiography, "Little Girl Lost". She successfully made the transition from child star to adult actress with a number of films including "Poison Ivy", "Bad Girls", "Boys on the Side", and "Everyone Says I Love You". Subsequently, she established herself in romantic comedies such as "The Wedding Singer" and "50 First Dates".
In 1997 she and business partner Nancy Juvonen formed the production company Flower Films, with its first production the 1999 Barrymore film "Never Been Kissed". Flower Films has gone on to produce the Barrymore vehicle films "Charlie's Angels", "50 First Dates", and "Music and Lyrics", as well as the cult film "Donnie Darko". Barrymore's more recent projects include "He's Just Not That into You", "Beverly Hills Chihuahua", "Everybody's Fine" and "Going the Distance". A recipient of a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, Barrymore appeared on the cover of the 2007 "People" magazine's 100 Most Beautiful issue.
Barrymore was named Ambassador Against Hunger for the UN World Food Programme (WFP). Since then, she has donated over US$1 million to the program. In 2007, she became both CoverGirl's newest model and spokeswoman for the cosmetic and the face for Gucci's newest jewelry line. In 2010, she was awarded the Screen Actors Guild Award and the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Miniseries or Television Film for her portrayal of Little Edie in "Grey Gardens".
Early life.
Barrymore was born in Culver City, California, the daughter of American actor John Drew Barrymore and Jaid Barrymore ( Makó), an aspiring actress. Barrymore's mother was born in a Displaced Persons camp in Brannenburg, West Germany, to Hungarian World War II refugees. Barrymore's father was of mainly English, and Irish, ancestry. Her parents divorced in 1984, when she was nine years old. She has one half-brother, John Blyth Barrymore, also an actor, and two half-sisters, Blyth Dolores Barrymore and (Brahma) Jessica Blyth Barrymore.
Barrymore was born into acting: her great-grandparents Maurice Barrymore and Georgie Drew Barrymore, Maurice Costello and Mae Costello ( Altschuk) and her grandparents John Barrymore and Dolores Costello, were all actors; John Barrymore was arguably the most acclaimed actor of his generation. She is the niece of Diana Barrymore and the grandniece of Lionel Barrymore, Ethel Barrymore and Helene Costello, the great-great-granddaughter of John Drew and actress Louisa Lane Drew, and the great grandniece of Broadway idol John Drew, Jr. and silent film actor/writer/director Sidney Drew. She is also the god-daughter of director Steven Spielberg, and Sophia Loren.
Her first name, Drew, was the maiden name of her paternal great-grandmother, Georgie Drew Barrymore; her middle name, Blyth, was the original surname of the dynasty founded by her great-grandfather, Maurice Barrymore.
Career.
Early career.
Barrymore's career began when she was auditioned for a dog food commercial at 11 months old. When she was bitten by her canine co-star, the producers were afraid she would cry, but she merely laughed, and was hired for the job. She made her film debut in "Altered States" (1980), in which she had a small part. A year later, she landed the role of Gertie, the younger sister of Elliott, in "E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial", which made her one of the most famous child stars of the time and earned her the Young Artist Award as Best Young Supporting Actress in a Motion Picture in 1982. She received a Golden Globe nomination as Best Supporting Actress in a Motion Picture in 1984 for her role in "Irreconcilable Differences", in which she starred as a young girl divorcing her parents. In a review in the "Chicago Sun-Times", Roger Ebert states: "Barrymore is the right actress for this role precisely because she approaches it with such grave calm."
Rebellious era.
In the wake of this sudden stardom, Barrymore endured a notoriously troubled childhood. She was already a regular at the famed Studio 54 when she was a little girl, smoking cigarettes at age nine, drinking alcohol by the time she was 11, smoking marijuana at 12, and snorting cocaine at 13. Her nightlife and constant partying became a popular subject with the media. She was in rehab at age 13. A suicide attempt at age 14 put her back in rehab, followed by a three-month stay with singer David Crosby and his wife. The stay was precipitated, Crosby said, because she "needed to be around some people that were committed to sobriety." Barrymore later described this period of her life in her autobiography, "Little Girl Lost." The next year, following a successful juvenile court petition for emancipation, she moved into her own apartment.
In 1993, Barrymore earned a second Golden Globe nomination, this time for the film "Guncrazy". Barrymore would go on to pose nude at age 19 for the January 1995 issue of "Playboy". Steven Spielberg, who directed her in "E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial" when she was a child and was her godfather, gave her a quilt for her 20th birthday with a note that read, "Cover yourself up". Enclosed were copies of her "Playboy" pictures, with the pictures altered by his art department so that she appeared fully clothed. During a 1995 appearance on "Late Show with David Letterman", Barrymore climbed onto David Letterman's desk and bared her breasts to him, her back to the camera, in celebration of his birthday. She modeled in a series of "Guess?" jeans ads during this time.
Return to prominence.
In 1995, Barrymore starred in "Boys on the Side" opposite Whoopi Goldberg and Mary-Louise Parker, and had a cameo role in Joel Schumacher's film "Batman Forever", in which she portrayed a moll to Tommy Lee Jones' character, Two-Face. The following year, she made a cameo in the successful horror film "Scream". Barrymore has continued to be highly bankable, and a top box office draw. She was frequently cast in romantic comedies such as "Wishful Thinking" (1997), "The Wedding Singer" (1998), and "Home Fries" (1998). Barrymore's role in the costume drama "Ever After" (1998) offered a modern take on the classic fairy tale of Cinderella and served as a reminder, according to Roger Ebert, of how well Drew Barrymore "can hold the screen and involve us in her characters".
Besides a number of appearances in films produced by her company, Flower Films, including "Charlie's Angels", Barrymore had a dramatic role in the comedy/drama "Riding in Cars with Boys" (2001), playing a teenage mother in a failed marriage with the drug-addicted father (based on the real-life story of Beverly D'Onofrio). In 2002, Barrymore appeared in "Confessions of a Dangerous Mind", alongside Sam Rockwell and Julia Roberts.
Flower Films and later work.
In 1995, Barrymore formed Flower Films, a production company, with business partner Nancy Juvonen. The first film produced by the company was 1999's "Never Been Kissed". The second offering from the company was "Charlie's Angels" (2000), a major box office success in 2000 that helped solidify the standing of both Barrymore and the company. When the production of Richard Kelly's debut film, "Donnie Darko", was threatened, Barrymore stepped forward with financing from Flower Films and took the small role of Karen Pomeroy, the title character's English teacher. Although the film was less than successful at the box office in the wake of 9/11, it reached cult film status after the DVD release, inspiring numerous websites devoted to unraveling the plot twists and meanings.
In 2003, she reprised her role as Dylan Sanders in "", was nominated for an Emmy Award for her performance in "Olive, the Other Reindeer" and appeared with Ben Stiller in "Duplex" in 2003. Flower Films produced "50 First Dates" with co-star Adam Sandler's Happy Madison company in 2004. Summing up Barrymore's appeal, Roger Ebert, in his review of "50 First Dates", described Barrymore as having a "smiling, coy sincerity," describing the film as "ingratiating and lovable." "50 First Dates" was followed by "Fever Pitch" (2005), and in 2007, "Music and Lyrics" and "Lucky You". Barrymore's more recent projects include "Beverly Hills Chihuahua" in 2008, and 2009's "He's Just Not That into You", "Grey Gardens" and "Everybody's Fine". Barrymore's directorial debut film "Whip It", was released in October 2009. "Whip It" starred Ellen Page and Marcia Gay Harden and centered on an obsession with beauty pageants and the Austin, Texas, Hurl Scouts roller derby team. Barrymore also co-starred in the film.
In 2010, Barrymore reunited with former partner Justin Long on the set of "Going the Distance", directed by Nanette Burstein. An R-rated romantic comedy about a couple dealing the ups and downs of a long distance relationship while commuting between New York City and San Francisco, the largely improvised film garnered generally mixed reviews by critics, who summed it as "timelier and a little more honest than most romantic comedies." Budgeted at US$32 million, the film became a moderate financial success at a worldwide box office total of US$40 million.
In 2011, it was announced that Barrymore had been cast alongside John Krasinski in Ken Kwapis's "Big Miracle" (2012), a romantic drama based on the 1989 book "Freeing the Whales", which covers Operation Breakthrough, the 1988 international effort to rescue gray whales from being trapped in ice near Point Barrow, Alaska.
On August 2, 2011, Barrymore directed the music video for the song "Our Deal", for the band Best Coast, which features Chloë Grace Moretz, Miranda Cosgrove, Tyler Posey, Donald Glover, Shailene Woodley and Alia Shawkat.

She was the subject of the 2005 documentary "My Date with Drew". In it, an aspiring filmmaker and a fan of Barrymore's, uses his limited resources in an attempt to gain a date with her. On February 3, 2004, she received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.

She has brought not only her personality into this endorsement but also her creative side, as she is also a co-creator of the ads. She was No. 1 in "People"'s annual 100 Most Beautiful People list in 2007. Also in 2007, she was named the new face for the Gucci jewelry line. Barrymore is signed to IMG Models New York City.

She hopes to expose her work in a gallery one day, as she documented the last decade of her life with a Pentax camera.

Concerning her sexuality, in an interview with Contact Music in 2003, Barrymore said "Do I like women sexually? Yeah, I do. Totally. I have always considered myself bisexual." Barrymore was quoted in 2004 as saying, "A woman and a woman together are beautiful, just as a man and a woman together are beautiful. Being with a woman is like exploring your own body, but through someone else. When I was younger I used to go with lots of women. Totally. I love it".

David Jude Heyworth Law (born 29 December 1972), known professionally as Jude Law, is an English actor, film producer and director.
He began acting with the National Youth Music Theatre in 1987, and had his first television role in 1989. After starring in films directed by Andrew Niccol, Clint Eastwood and David Cronenberg, he was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor in 1999 for his performance in Anthony Minghella's "The Talented Mr. Ripley". In 2000 he won a Best Supporting Actor BAFTA Award for his work in the film. In 2003, he was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actor for his performance in another Minghella film, "Cold Mountain".
In 2006, he was one of the top ten most bankable film stars in Hollywood. In 2007, he received an Honorary César and he was named a Chevalier of the "Ordre des Arts et des Lettres" by the French government. He was a member of the main competition jury at the 2011 Cannes Film Festival.
Early life.
Law was born in Lewisham, South London, the second child of comprehensive school teachers Margaret Anne (née Heyworth) and Peter Robert Law; his father later became, according to Law, "the youngest headmaster in London". He has a sister, Natasha. Law was named after a "bit of both" the book "Jude the Obscure" and the Beatles song "Hey Jude". He grew up in Blackheath, an area in the Borough of Lewisham, and was educated at John Ball Primary School in Blackheath and Kidbrooke School, before attending the Alleyn's School.
Career.
1980s–1990s.
In 1987, Law began acting with the National Youth Music Theatre. He played various roles in the Edinburgh Fringe-awarded play "The Ragged Child". One of his first major stage roles was Foxtrot Darling in Philip Ridley's "The Fastest Clock in the Universe". Law went on to appear as Michael in the West End production of Jean Cocteau's tragicomedy "Les Parents terribles", directed by Sean Mathias. For this play, he was nominated for a Laurence Olivier Award for Outstanding Newcomer, and he received the Ian Charleson Award for Outstanding Newcomer.
Following a title change to "Indiscretions", the play was reworked and transferred to Broadway in 1995, where Law acted opposite Kathleen Turner, Roger Rees and Cynthia Nixon. This role earned him a Tony Award nomination and the Theatre World Award. In 1989, Law got his first television role, in a film based on the Beatrix Potter children's book, "The Tailor of Gloucester". After minor roles in British television, including a two-year stint in the Granada TV soap opera "Families", the leading role in the BFI /Channel 4 short "The Crane", Law had his breakthrough with the British crime drama "Shopping", which also featured his future wife, Sadie Frost, and a minor role in the episode "Shoscombe Old Place" in Granada's television series "Sherlock Holmes".
In 1997, he became more widely known with his role in the Oscar Wilde bio-pic "Wilde". Law won the "Most Promising Newcomer" award from the Evening Standard British Film Awards for his role as Lord Alfred "Bosie" Douglas, the glamorous lover of Stephen Fry's Wilde. In Andrew Niccol's science fiction film "Gattaca", Law played the role of a disabled former swimming star living in a eugenics-obsessed dystopia. In Clint Eastwood's "Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil", he played the role of the ill-fated hustler murdered by an art dealer, played by Kevin Spacey.
For "The Talented Mr. Ripley" in 1999, he learned to play saxophone and earned an MTV Movie Award nomination with Matt Damon and Fiorello for performing the song ""Tu vuò fà l'americano"" by Renato Carosone and Nicola Salerno.
2000s.
In 2001, Law starred as Russian sniper Vasily Zaytsev in the film "Enemy at the Gates", and learned ballet dancing for the film "A.I. Artificial Intelligence" (2001). In 2002, he played a mob hitman in Sam Mendes's 1930s period drama "Road to Perdition". He was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for his performance in "The Talented Mr. Ripley" in 1999, and then again for the Academy Award for Best Actor for "Cold Mountain" in 2003. Both films were directed by Anthony Minghella.
Law, an admirer of Laurence Olivier, used the actor's image in the 2004 film "Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow". Using computer graphics, footage of the young Olivier was merged into the film, playing Dr. Totenkopf, a mysterious scientific genius and supervillain. Also in 2004, he portrayed the title character in "Alfie", the remake of Bill Naughton's 1966 film, playing the role originated by Michael Caine. Law was one of the Top Ten 2006 A-list of the most bankable film stars in Hollywood, according to the Ulmer Scale. On 1 March 2007, he was honoured with the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres conferred by the French government, in recognition of his contribution to World Cinema Arts. He was named a "Chevalier des Arts et des Lettres".
He took on another of Caine's earlier roles in the 2007 film "Sleuth", adapted by Nobel Laureate in Literature Harold Pinter, while Caine played the role originated by Sir Laurence Olivier.
Law is one of three actors who took over the role of actor Heath Ledger in Terry Gilliam's film "The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus". Along with Law, actors Johnny Depp and Colin Farrell portray "three separate dimensions in the film." He appeared opposite Forest Whitaker in the dark science fiction comedy "Repo Men" and as Dr. Watson in Guy Ritchie's adaption of "Sherlock Holmes", alongside Robert Downey, Jr. and Rachel McAdams, as well as the 2011 sequel, "". Law starred as a celebrity supermodel in the film "Rage", and blogger and "prophet" Alan Krumwiede in the 2011 medical thriller "Contagion".
"Hamlet".
In May 2009, Law returned to the London stage to portray the title role in Shakespeare's "Hamlet" at the Donmar Warehouse West End season at Wyndham's Theatre. The BBC reported "a fine and solid performance" but included other reviews of Law's interpretation that were mixed. There was a further run of the production at Elsinore Castle in Denmark from 25–30 August 2009. In September 2009 the production transferred to the Broadhurst Theatre in New York. Again, the critics failed to agree on the merit of Law's interpretation: London's "Daily Mail" found only positive reviews, but "The Washington Post" felt that the much-anticipated performance was "highly disappointing". Nonetheless, he was nominated for the 2010 Tony Award for Best Performance by a Leading Actor in a Play. In January 2010 at the Critics' Circle Theatre Awards ceremony he was presented with the John and Wendy Trewin Award for Best Shakespearean Performance for his 2009 Hamlet.
Other projects.
Advertising.
Law is the face of the male perfume of Dior, "Dior Homme Sport". Since 2005, he has represented Dunhill as an "apparel ambassador" in Asia. In 2008, he became the international face of Dunhill and appears in the worldwide advertising campaigns.
In 2002, he directed a Respect for Animals anti-fur cinema commercial. The commercial, titled "Fur and Against", used music composed by Gary Kemp, and included appearances by Law, Chrissie Hynde, Moby, George Michael, Danny Goffey, Rhys Ifans, Sadie Frost, Helena Christensen, Sir Paul McCartney, Mel C and Stella McCartney.
"Realtime Movie".
In early 2007 Law shot the Jason Martin-directed short film "Realtime Movie Trailer" at Borough Market, South London. Instead of promoting a film, this "trailer", which appeared among regular trailers in selected cinemas across London starting 19 November 2007, advertised a live event, Realtime Movie, by Polish artist Paweł Althamer. Hundreds turned up for this–unfilmed–re-enactment in real time of the sequence of events shown in "Realtime Movie Trailer" by the same actors, including Althamer as a Polish labourer, held at Borough Market on 30 November 2007. The performance was commissioned by Tate Modern as part of its "The World as a Stage" exhibition which explored the boundaries between arts and reality.
Charity activities.
In 2004, Law launched a campaign to raise £2.5 million towards the Young Vic Theatre's £12.5 million redevelopment project. He is currently Chairman of the Young Vic committee and has said that he is proud to help make the Young Vic "a nurturing bed" for young directors. In 2006, he joined Robbie Williams in the "Soccer Aid" celebrity football match to benefit UNICEF.
In 2006, he starred in an anthology of Samuel Beckett readings and performances directed by director Anthony Minghella. With the Beckett Gala Evening at the Reading Town Hall, more than £22,000 was donated for the Macmillan Cancer Support. Also in 2006, Frost and Law directed a Shakespeare play in a South African orphanage. He travelled to Durban with Frost and their children in order to help children who have lost their parents to AIDS. In July 2007, as patron of the charity, he helped kick off the month-long tour of the AIDS-themed musical "Thula Sizwe" by the Young Zulu Warriors. Also in 2007, he encouraged the Friends of the Earth/the Big Ask campaign, asking British Government to take action against climate change.
Law does charity work for organisations such as Make Poverty History, the Rhys Daniels Trust, and the WAVE Trauma Centre. He supports the Make-A-Wish Foundation and the Pride of Britain Awards.
He is the chairman of the Music For Tomorrow Foundation to help rebuild Katrina-devastated New Orleans.
Jude Law is an ambassador of the Prince of Wales' Children and the Arts Foundation. He supports Breast Cancer Care, and in December 2008 he supported the Willow Foundation with a small canvas for their campaign Stars on Canvas. In April 2009 he supported the charity Education Africa with the gift of a mask he had painted and signed himself. The campaign was launched on eBay by Education Africa.
Stars including Dame Judi Dench and Jude Law have helped save St Stephen's Church in Hampstead. The celebrities supported the campaign, which raised £4.5 million to refurbish the Victorian church in North London. The building reopened in March 2009 as an arts and community centre.
Peace activities.
In July 2007, Jude Law and Jeremy Gilley were in Afghanistan over a period of 10 days to document peace commitments and activities there for an upcoming film and for marking the UN International Day of Peace. Accompanied by UNICEF Representative Catherine Mbengue, they travelled and filmed in dangerous areas of eastern Afghanistan with a film crew, interviewing children, government ministers, community leaders and UN officials. They also filmed at schools and visited various UNICEF-supported programmes inside and outside the capital Kabul. The efforts of Peace One Day are coordinated in celebration of the annual International Day of Peace, on 21 September. The film, named "The Day After Peace", premiered at the Cannes Film Festival. On 21 September 2008, the film was shown at a gala screening at the Royal Albert Hall.
On 30 August 2008, Law and Gilley returned to Afghanistan to help keep a momentum around Peace Day. They met President Hamid Karzai, top NATO and UN officials, and members of the aid community. They also screened the new documentary about the efforts in support of peace. The documentary features activities that took place throughout Afghanistan in 2007. It also highlights support from UNICEF and the WHO for the peaceful immunisation of 1.4 million children against polio in insecure areas.
Belarus.
In 2011 Law joined street protests against Alexander Lukashenko and Lukashenko's brutal crackdown on the Belarusian democracy movement.
Personal life.
Law's parents live in Vaudelnay, France, where they run their own drama school and theatre. His sister Natasha is an illustrator and artist, living in London.
Law met actress Sadie Frost while working on the film "Shopping". They married on 2 September 1997 and divorced on 29 October 2003. He has three children with Frost: son Rafferty (born 1996), daughter Iris (born 2000), and son Rudy (born 2002).
While making the film "Alfie" in late 2003, Law and co-star Sienna Miller began a relationship, becoming engaged on Christmas Day 2004. On 8 July 2005, Law issued a public apology to Miller for having an affair with the nanny of his children. Miller and Law separated in November 2006.
On 29 July 2009, it was announced that Law would become a father for the fourth time following a brief relationship with American model Samantha Burke in 2008. Burke gave birth to a daughter, Sophia, in September 2009 in New York.
In December 2009, it was reported that Law and Miller had rekindled their relationship after starring in separate shows on Broadway in late 2009. They spent Christmas 2009 in Barbados, along with three of Law's children. They announced they had split again in February 2011.

This is a list of notable and commonly used emoticons or textual portrayals of a writer's mood or facial expression in the form of icons. The Western use of emoticons is quite different from Eastern usage, and Internet forums, such as 2channel, typically, show expressions in their own ways. In recent times, graphic representations, both static and animated, have taken the place of traditional emoticons in the form of icons.
Western.
The emoticon in Western style is written most often from left to right as though the head is rotated counter-clockwise 90 degrees. Thus, most commonly, one will see the eyes on the left, followed by the nose (often not included) and mouth. Typically, a colon is used for the eyes of a face, unless a wink is to be implied (this would use a semicolon to imply one closed eye). However, an equal sign, a number 8, and a capital letter B are also used interchangeably to refer to normal eyes or those with glasses. Also, you can add a "}" after the mouth symbol"(", ")", etc.to indicate a beard.
Eastern.
Eastern emoticons generally are not rotated, and may include non-Latin characters to allow for additional complexity.
Unicode characters.
Some emoticons are included in the Unicode standardâ€”three in the Miscellaneous Symbols block, and over sixty in the Emoticons block.

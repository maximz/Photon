James Brolin (; born July 18, 1940) is an American actor, producer and director, best known for his roles in film and television, including sitcoms and soap operas. He is the father of actor Josh Brolin and husband of singer/actress Barbra Streisand.
Early life.
Brolin was born Craig Kenneth Bruderlin in Los Angeles, California. The eldest of two brothers and two sisters, he was the son of Helen Sue (née Mansur), a homemaker, and Henry Hurst Bruderlin, a building contractor. The family settled in Westwood after his birth. As a young child, he was apparently more interested in animals and airplanes than in acting. When Brolin was 10 in 1950, he began building and flying model airplanes. As a teenaged filmgoer in the mid-1950s he was particularly fascinated with actor James Dean. When his parents invited a director over to his family's house for dinner before auditioning, he met another fellow actor and classmate, Ryan O'Neal, who was about a year younger than Brolin. The two clicked and later enrolled in University High School located in West Los Angeles. However, Bruderlin's own acting exposed his stifling shyness. His assurance grew when O'Neal invited him to a casting agency. Brolin graduated from high school in 1958, and his family was already encouraging him to become an actor like O'Neal.

Early career.
Prior to taking acting classes in school, Brolin started out as a character actor on an episode of "Bus Stop" in 1961.

Brolin also had small roles in several films including "Take Her, She's Mine" (1963), "Dear Brigitte" (1965), "Von Ryan's Express" (1965), "Fantastic Voyage" (1966).

Film work.
During the 1970s, the 6 ft 4 inch Brolin began appearing in leading roles in films, including "Skyjacked" (1972), and "Westworld" (1973). By the mid-1970s, he was a regular leading man in films, starring in "Gable and Lombard" (1976), "The Car" (1977), "Capricorn One" (1978, in which he costarred with Elliott Gould, Streisand's ex-husband), "The Amityville Horror" (1979), "Night of the Juggler" (1980), and "High Risk" (1981). When Roger Moore expressed his desire to leave the role of James Bond, Brolin screen tested for the role in the next film "Octopussy" (1983). Ultimately, however, Moore decided to continue in the series.

Television roles.
In 1968, Brolin transferred to Universal Studios, where he auditioned for a co-starring role opposite seasoned actor Robert Young in the popular medical drama "Marcus Welby, M.D." (1969–1976). The series was one of the top-rated television shows of the day. Brolin became widely known for his portrayal of youthful, skilled assistant physician Dr. Steven Kiley. The chemistry between Young & Brolin clicked, and even came to attract young women for its medical interest throughout the show's run. In its first season in 1970, Brolin won the Emmy Award for Outstanding Performance by an Actor in a Supporting Role, and was subsequently nominated three more times. He was also nominated for Golden Globes three times for Best Supporting Actor, and won twice between 1971 and 1973.

In 1983, Brolin returned to television to star in another popular series. He teamed with producer Aaron Spelling's prime-time soap opera, "Hotel", for ABC. On this show he played Peter MacDermott, a hotel manager who tried to help everyone solve their problems while letting love come into his own life at the same time. Co-starring on the show was a new actress, Shari Belafonte (The daughter of singer Harry Belafonte), as Peter's receptionist, Julie Gillette, a familiar actress, Connie Sellecca, as Brolin's promotions manager and later girlfriend, Christine Francis, and Nathan Cook as Billy Griffin, an ex-con who later became Peter's best friend.

Brolin was nominated twice for Golden Globes between 1983 and 1984 for Best Performance By an Actor in a TV Series, but didn't win either time. He would eventually serve as a director on the show, as well. On one episode of "Hotel", he invited his future wife Jan Smithers to guest-star on the show as the writers suggested that they develop a storyline for them, as Brolin was going through a difficult divorce at the time. By 1988, after 5 seasons, "Hotel" was about to close its doors for good and the show was cancelled. That same year, his co-star, Cook had died of an allergic reaction to penicillin, and Brolin along with the rest of his cast attended his funeral.
Sellecca said of Brolin's on-screen chemistry with him on "Hotel", "I remember instantly feeling comfortable with Jim, and that's the thing that Jim has as to women, most women, they need to feel safe, and Jim gets that." She also said, "To have him in a different role and have that confidence, it was a wonderful experience." After the show's cancellation, Sellecca continues to be good friends with Brolin.

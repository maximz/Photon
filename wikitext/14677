Plot.
Anubis House is a residence at an English boarding school dating from the 1890s, and currently serving as a home for nine young people under the watch of the boarding school's strict caretaker, Victor Rodenmaar Jr (Francis Magee). As an American girl named Nina Martin (Nathalia Ramos) moves into Anubis House in England, another resident named Joy Mercer (Klariza Clayton), suddenly disappears without a warning and the school staff eliminate all trace of Joy's existence from the school. Joy's best friend, Patricia Williamson (Jade Ramsey) is dismayed to learn this and accuses Nina of being involved with her disappearance. Forced to spend a night in the attic, Nina makes a bizarre discovery: the recorded diary of a young girl who she met earlier as an old woman, Sarah Frobisher-Smythe (Rita Davies), who had lived in the house long ago. On the tapes, it is revealed the house has a secret history, a mystery that nobody knows anything about. Sarah has given Nina an Eye of Horus-shaped necklace with mysterious powers revealed to Nina when she decides to investigate the house's mystery alongside her new friend Fabian Rutter (Brad Kavanagh) and new roommate Amber Millington (Ana Mulvoy Ten). They form a secret group called "Sibuna", (Anubis backwards) whose popularity expands to include Patricia, once she makes peace with Nina, and after learning that Joy's disappearance is connected to the house, and Alfie Lewis (Alex Sawyer), another classmate and prankster. Eventually, Jerome Clarke (Eugene Simon) joins in the mystery as well. The other residents are oblivious to the mystery; Mara Jaffray, Mick Campbell, and Trudy, the housemother. 
During the events of the first season, the Sibuna group learns that Victor is the son of Victor Rodenmaar Sr, Sarah's childhood guardian, who was after what is revealed to be the Cup of Ankh that gives immortality to anyone who drinks from it. Furthermore, Victor is the current leader of a secret Society dedicated to finding the cup in order to obtain immortality and at odds with a former Society member named Rufus Zeno who wants the Cup for himself. Joy has disappeared because of this group who believe her to be the Chosen One. The first season ends when Nina is revealed to be the real Chosen One as Rufus drinks what he thought was Victor's life-extending elixir before seemingly destroying the Cup. But the Cup is revealed not to have been burned as Nina hides it.
In Season 2, Mick leaves Anubis House and moves to Australia, and a new student named Eddie Miller joins their dorm. Eddie is later revealed to be Edison Sweet, Mr. Sweet's American son. Eddie begins dating Patricia. Nina and Sibuna are forced into helping an evil Egyptian woman, Senkhara, to find a relic called the Mask of Anubis, which is located a series of chambers under the house. This mask, when worn by the Chosen One, weeps tears of gold that are needed to create the elixir of life. Victor attempts to get the Mask with the aid of the new housemother, Vera Devenish, who is secretly working for Rufus Zeno after he faked his death. If Sibuna doesn't get the mask Sibuna will die. In the end, after the Mask is found, it is revealed that Eddie is the Osirian, the protector of the Chosen One, as he saves Nina from being possessed by Senkhara, when she and Rufus get sucked into a flame-filled abyss. Joy is also knocked out and unconcious by Nina when Nina is possessed by Senkhara. Though Victor is forced to use the mask's tears to heal Joy, his father's ring that he received from Nina contained a tear of gold. In the end Fabian and Nina get back together, as well as Amber and Alfie, and Jerome and Mara begin dating.

Melody Simpson of Buzz Focus, also reviewed the pilot and stated, "While this is not exactly a series one would watch with the entire family, the older audiences will surely enjoy this series as much as the younger audiences." Pittsburgh Post-Gazette's Rob Owen compared the show as a "lighter, better executed version of the fall CW pilot "Ringer"."

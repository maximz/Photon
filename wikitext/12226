This is a list of the world's sovereign states and their dependent territories by area, ranked by total area.
Entries in this list comprise those in the ISO standard 3166-1, which includes sovereign states and dependent territories. Largely unrecognised states are included in the list in ranked order, but are not actually given a rank number. Not included in the list are individual country claims to parts of the continent of Antarctica, and entities such as the European Union ( total area) that have some degree of sovereignty but do not consider themselves to be sovereign countries or dependent territories. States with limited recognition that are not listed in the ISO standard ISO 3166-1 are not included, but are noted within the countries they are recognised as part of with areas given.
Data are taken from the United Nations Statistics Division unless otherwise noted.

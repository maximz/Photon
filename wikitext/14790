Plot.
Set in the rustic surroundings of a village in Haryana, the film is a comedy-drama about Harry Mandola (Pankaj Kapur), a wealthy industrialist who loves his drink, his daughter Bijlee (Anushka Sharma) and the unusual bond they both share with Harryâ€™s Man Friday, Matru (Imran Khan). Matru studies LLB in Jawaharlal Nehru University(However, there is no such course in the University, factually) but does not get a job upon graduation and returns to his village to take up his family profession of serving the Mandola family. Also Bijlli is in love with him. Bijlee later goes to Oxford University where she meets Badal (Arya Babbar), the son of a powerful politician, Chaudhari Devi(Shabana Azmi), and pretends to fall in love with him to make Matru jealous. Much to her father's delight, Bijlee seems all set to marry Baadal. This alliance, far from a simple love story of two young people, becomes the basis for a complex, political narrative, that brings twists and turns in the lives of Matru, Bijlee and Mandola.

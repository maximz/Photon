Hammond co-hosted "Total Wipeout" with Amanda Byram on BBC One from 2009 until its cancellation in 2012. Hammond presented "Planet Earth Live" alongside Julia Bradbury.
Early life.
Hammond was born in Solihull and is the grandson of workers in the Birmingham automobile industry. In the mid-1980s Hammond moved with his family (mother Eileen, father Alan, and younger brothers Andrew, writer of the 'Crypt' Series, and Nicholas) to the North Yorkshire cathedral city of Ripon where his father ran a probate business in the market square. Originally a pupil of Solihull School, a fee-paying boys' independent school, he moved to Ripon Grammar School, and from 1987 to 1989 attended Harrogate College of Art and Technology. After his graduation he worked for several radio stations, including Radio Cleveland, Radio York, Radio Cumbria, Radio Leeds, Radio Newcastle and Radio Lancashire, before auditioning for "Top Gear".
Top Gear.
Hammond became a presenter on "Top Gear" in 2002, when the show began in its present format. He is sometimes referred to as "The Hamster" by fans and his co-presenters on "Top Gear" due to his name and comparatively small stature. His nickname was further reinforced when on three separate occasions in series 7, Hammond ate cardboard, mimicking hamster-like behaviour.
Following a high-speed dragster crash while filming in September 2006, Hammond returned in the first episode of series 9 (broadcast on 28 January 2007) to a hero's welcome, complete with dancing girls, aeroplane style stairs and fireworks. The show also contained images of the crash, which had made international headlines, with Hammond talking through the events of the day after which the audience broke into spontaneous applause. Hammond then requested that the crash never be mentioned on the show again, though all three "Top Gear" presenters have since referred to it in jokes during the news segment of the programme. He told his colleagues, "The only difference between me now, and before the crash, is that I like celery now and I didn't before".
During the third episode of series sixteen, Hammond suggested that no one would ever want to own a Mexican car, since cars are supposed to reflect national characteristics and so a Mexican car would be a "lazy, feckless, flatulent, overweight oaf." Hammond finished with the remark "I'm sorry, but can you imagine waking up and remembering you're Mexican?!" Following complaints, the BBC defended the broadcast of this segment on the grounds that such national stereotyping was a "robust part" of traditional British humour.
Brainiac: Science Abuse.
In 2003, Hammond became the first presenter of ""; he was joined by Jon Tickle with Charlotte Hudson in series 2. After the fourth series it was announced that Hammond was no longer going to present the Sky1 show after he signed an exclusive deal with the BBC. Vic Reeves took his place as main presenter.
Other television work.
Early in his career, as well as his radio work, Hammond presented a number of daytime lifestyle shows and motoring programmes such as Motor Week on "Men & Motors".
He presented the "Crufts" dog show in 2005, the 2004 and 2005 British Parking Awards, and has appeared on "School's Out", a quiz show on BBC One where celebrities answer questions about things they learned at school. He has also presented '. Along with his work on "Top Gear", he presented "Should I Worry About...?" on BBC One, "Time Commanders" on BBC Two and the first four series of ' on Sky One. He was also a team captain on the BBC Two quiz show, "Petrolheads", in which a memorable part was one where Hammond was tricked into smashing his classic Ferrari while trying to parallel park blindfolded in another car.
From 3 January 2006 until 10 February 2006, Hammond was the eponymous star of "Richard Hammond's 5 O'Clock Show" with his co-star Mel Giedroyc of "Light Lunch" fame. The programme, which discussed a wide range of topics, was shown every weekday on ITV between 17:00 and 18:00.
In July 2005, Hammond was voted number one in a "Heat" magazine poll of top "weird celebrity crushes". Also in 2005 he was voted one of the top 10 British TV talents.
He presented "Richard Hammond and the Holy Grail" in 2006. During the special, he travelled to various locations around the world, including the Vatican Secret Archives, exploring the history of the Holy Grail.
In one episode of "Top Gear", fellow presenter James May was mocked by both Hammond and Clarkson for being named the celebrity with the worst hairstyle, while Hammond was named the celebrity with the best.
As part of Red Nose Day 2007, Hammond stood for nomination via a public telephone vote, along with Andy Hamilton and Kelvin MacKenzie, to be a one-off co-presenter of BBC Radio 4's Woman's Hour on 16 March 2007. However, he was defeated by Andy Hamilton.
In April 2007, Hammond presented a one off special on BBC Radio 2 for Good Friday followed by another in August 2007 for the Bank Holiday.
Hammond recorded an interview with the famed American stuntman Evel Knievel, which aired on 23 December 2007 on BBC Two, and was Knievel's last interview before his death on 30 November 2007.
In September 2008, Hammond presented the first episode of a new series; "Richard Hammond's Engineering Connections" on the National Geographic Channel. In this show, Hammond discovers how the inventions of the past, along with assistance from nature, help designers today. Episodes include the building of the Airbus A380, Taipei 101 and the Keck Observatory. Series 2 of Richard Hammond's Engineering Connections began in May 2010 and has included the building of the Wembley Stadium and the Sydney Opera House.
Hammond also filmed an advertisement for Morrisons supermarkets in 2008, and joined the cast of TV show "Ashes To Ashes" for a special insert on the 2008 Children in Need special.
While in New Zealand for "Top Gear Live 2009", Hammond filmed several television commercials for Telecom New Zealand's new XT UTMS mobile network. Telecom claimed that the new network was "faster in more places", compared to its competitors and its existing CDMA network. After the network suffered three highly-publicised outages in late 2009 and early 2010, Hammond became the butt of a joke when he did not return to New Zealand for "Top Gear Live 2010". His fellow "Top Gear" co-hosts said he was too embarrassed to come back to New Zealand, and in a supposed live feed back to Hammond, the feed suddenly drops out as the "XT Network had crashed". Hammond was later given the right of reply to his colleagues during an interview with Marcus Lush on RadioLIVE's breakfast show in New Zealand.
Hammond is currently hosting the UK version of the US series "Wipeout", called "Total Wipeout" for BBC One. It takes place in Argentina, and is co-presented by Hammond and Amanda Byram.

In March 2010, Hammond presented a 3 episode series called Richard Hammond's Invisible Worlds, which looked at things too fast for the naked eye to see, things that are beyond the visible spectrum (e.g. ultraviolet and infra-red light), as well as microscopic things.
One of Hammond's lesser known television roles was as presenter of the BBC2 'gameshow' Time Commanders, a sophisticated warfare simulator which used a modified version of Creative Assembly's game engine.
Since February 2011, Hammond has presented an online technology series ""Richard Hammond's Tech Head"".
In July 2011, Hammond presented a two-part natural science documentary "Richard Hammond's Journey to the Centre of the Planet", focused on Earth geology and plate tectonics.

Personal life.
Hammond has been married to Amanda Etheridge (mostly known as Mindy) since May 2002; the couple have two daughters. The family lives in a mock castle in Herefordshire and also has an apartment in London. Hammond also plays the bass guitar, on which he accompanied the other Top Gear presenters when they performed alongside Justin Hawkins on "Top Gear of the Pops" for Comic Relief in 2007. Hammond likes to ride his bicycle in cities, for which he is mocked mercilessly by fellow presenter Jeremy Clarkson.
Hammond is a fan of Porsche 911s and claims the Pagani Zonda to be the ultimate supercar. He once owned a 1982 Porsche 911 SC (sold in the mid-2000s), and later purchased a 2006 Porsche 911 (997) Carrera S. In 2004, Hammond purchased a Porsche 928 for the purpose of daily driving. Much unlike Clarkson and May, he also has an interest in American muscle cars, having owned a 1969 Dodge Charger R/T, a 1967 Ford Mustang GT 390, and a 2008 Dodge Challenger SRT-8 (which was purchased in the United States on a Series 12 episode of "Top Gear"). He also owns a BMW 850i, which was used to race against Clarkson's Mercedes CL600, which they both bought, on the show, to prove that one can purchase second hand cars, which were a better buy than the Nissan Pixo, Britain's cheapest car, at the time, for less money.
Hammond had also owned a Morgan AeroMax, in which he was involved in a car accident on 9 August 2009. He also owns a Jaguar E-Type and is also a fan of monster trucks, having attended Truckfest '07.
An interview with "The Sunday Times" in February 2008 reported Hammond as having moved briefly from Gloucestershire to Buckinghamshire, then back again because he missed the country life.
Hammond is a keen motorcyclist and Land Rover Defender fan. He spent over Â£70,000 rebuilding his 110 "Buster" in 2008.
During the news segment of Top Gear's 2010 USA Road Trip special, Hammond openly expressed his dislike of the band Genesis. This fact was later exploited by his co-presenters (particularly by Clarkson) in two special episodes: during the , when they installed a secret second stereo unit in his Fiat Barchetta that only plays the band's Live over Europe 2007 concert; in the , Clarkson played the same song used in the previous special through the megaphone mounted in his Jaguar XJS, despite Hammond driving a different car (a Mini Cooper Sport).
In October it was reported he had spent over Â£2Â million buying Bollitree Castle which is situated near Weston under Penyard, Ross-on-Wye. It has been rumoured he has also bought a large house in the small town of Wantage, Oxfordshire.
In 2007, Hammond went to Africa on a , with his choice of car being a 1963 Opel Kadett, which he subsequently named Oliver. A week after the special was aired, Hammond announced during the news section that he had shipped Oliver back to the UK, where it was restored by a team from "Practical Classics" magazine. Oliver features on Hammond's children's science television show "Richard Hammond's Blast Lab" and in another episode of Top Gear as a kind of "Hill-holder" in the trailer truck challenge (after it acquired the personal plate "OLI V3R"). Oliver is also mentioned in Hammond's second autobiography "As You Do".
In 2010, Hammond was the President of the 31st Herefordshire Country Fair held at Hampton Court in Hope under Dinmore. His involvement caused unprecedented attendance with "nearly 15,000 people" drawn to the event to meet the presenter.
In 2010, Hammond gained a private pilot licence (PPL)(H) in an Robinson R44 helicopter.
During series 18 of "Top Gear" it was revealed that he owns a Fiat 500 TwinAir.

Richard Hammond is a Vice-President of UK children's brain injury charity The Children's Trust, Tadworth.
"Vampire" dragster crash.
 filming of a "Top Gear" segment at the former RAF Elvington airbase near York on 20 September 2006, Hammond was injured in the crash of the jet-powered car he was piloting. Hammond was travelling at at the time of the crash.
His vehicle, a dragster called "Vampire", was theoretically capable of travelling at speeds of up to . The vehicle was the same car that in 2000, piloted by Colin Fallows, set the British land speed record at . The "Vampire" was powered by a single Bristol-Siddeley Orpheus afterburning turbojet engine producing .
Some accounts suggested that the accident occurred during an attempt to break the British land speed record, but the Health and Safety Executive report on the crash found that a proposal to try to officially break the record was vetoed in advance by "Top Gear" executive producer Andy Wilman, due to the risks and complexities of such a venture. (The report stated: "Runs were to be carried out in only one direction along a pre-set course on the Elvington runway. Vampireâ€™s speed was to be recorded using GPS satellite telemetry. The intention was to record the maximum speed, not to measure an average speed over a measured course, and for to describe how it felt.")
Hammond was completing a seventh and final run to collect extra footage for the programme when his front-right tyre failed, and, according to witness and first responder Dave Ogden, "one of the parachutes had deployed but it went on to the grass and spun over and over before coming to a rest about 100Â yards from us." The emergency crew quickly arrived at the car, finding it inverted and partially embedded in the grass. During the roll, Hammond's helmet had embedded itself into the ground, flipping the visor up and forcing soil into his mouth and left eye, damaging the eye. Rescuers felt a pulse and heard the unconscious Hammond breathing before the car was turned upright. Hammond was cut free with hydraulic shears, and placed on a backboard. "He was regaining consciousness at that point and said he had some lower back pain". He was then transported by the Yorkshire Air Ambulance to the neurological unit of the Leeds General Infirmary. Hammond's family visited him at the hospital along with "Top Gear" co-presenters James May and Jeremy Clarkson. Clarkson wished Hammond well, saying "Both James and I are looking forward to getting our 'Hamster' back", referring to Hammond by his nickname.
The Health & Safety Executive report stated that "Hammond's instantaneous reaction to the tyre blow out seems to have been that of a competent high performance car driver, namely to brake the car and to try to steer into the skid. Immediately afterwards he also seems to have followed his training and to have pulled back on the main parachute release lever, thus shutting down the jet engine and also closing the jet and afterburner fuel levers. The main parachute did not have time to deploy before the car ran off the runway." The HSE notes that, based on the findings of the North Yorkshire Police (who investigated the crash), "the accident may not have been recoverable", even if Hammond's efforts to react were as fast as "humanly possible".
The crash was shown on an episode of "Top Gear" on 28 January 2007; this was the first episode of the new series, which had been postponed pending Hammond's recovery. Hammond requested at the end of the episode that his fellow presenters never mention the crash again, a request which has been generally observed by both Hammond and the other presenters, although occasional oblique references have been made. "On The Edge: My Story", which contains first hand accounts from both Hammond and his wife about the crash, immediate aftermath, and his recovery was published later that year.
In February 2008 Hammond gave an interview to "The Sunday Times" newspaper in which he described the effects of his brain injuries and the progression of his recovery. He reported suffering loss of memory, depression, and difficulties with emotional experiences, for which he was consulting a psychiatrist. He also talked about his recovery in a 2010 television programme where he interviewed Sir Stirling Moss and they discussed the brain injuries they had both received as a result of car crashes.

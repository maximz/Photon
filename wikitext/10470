Duck Dynasty is a reality television series on A&E. It shows the lives of the Robertson family, who became wealthy from their family-operated business, Duck Commander, which makes products for duck hunters, primarily the duck call named "Duck Commander". The Robertson men, brothers Phil and Si, and Phil's sons Jase, Willie, and Jep, are known for their long-flowing beards.
The business began in a dilapidated family shed, where Phil Robertson spent 25 years making duck calls from Louisiana cedar trees. His son Willie is now the CEO of the company.
The family was previously featured on the series "Benelli Presents Duck Commander" and its spin-off "Buck Commander", which aired on the Outdoor Channel. The first season was released on iTunes and on DVD-R in July 2012 (the latter only available on Amazon.com through Manufacture on Demand). The DVD includes an option for Spanish subtitles. On both iTunes and DVD-R, the theme song ("Sharp Dressed Man") has been replaced by "Workin' Man Zombie" by Minneapolis, MN band, The 4onthefloor. Amazon.com also released the series through Amazon Instant Video.

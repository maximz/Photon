Jayantabhai Ki Luv Story is an upcoming Bollywood crime romance film directed by Vinnil Markan, and produced by Kumar Taurani under Tips Music Films. The film stars Vivek Oberoi opposite Neha Sharma in lead roles. The theatrical trailer unveiled on 11 January 2013, whilst the film is set to release on 15 February 2013, in celebration of Valentine's Day.
Premise.
The story is set in Mumbai, about a street-thug played by Vivek Oberoi, who unexpectedly falls in love with Neha Sharma, a young girl who acts simple but is a bigger rebel in person. It is a complete package romance caper about how people unknowingly fall in love with people they least expect to. The basic premise of the movie is inspired from a Korean movie--gangster love--released in 2010
Release.
The film was expected to release sometime during Summer 2012. In July 2012, the film's posters were released as a promotion for the film, in which it was also announced that the film has been scheduled to release in October 2012, thus clashing with actor Vivek Oberoi's "Kismet Love Paisa Dilli". The film's distributors Tips Music Films even released an song promo of the film, "Aa Bhi Ja Mere Mehermann" by Atif Aslam, in November 2012. Receiving hundred-thousands of hits, the promo was decided not to be deleted. Once again being delayed, the film was reported to release on 15 February 2013.
Soundtrack.
The music of the film will be directed by Sachin-Jigar while the lyrics are penned by Priya Panchal & Mayur Puri. The music of the film has become a great hit online. Atif Aslam has sung 3 songs in the film.
Critical Reception.
The film received only 59/100 on the true happiness score given by Movie Tarot. The only reason to watch this one is Neha Sharma. Mohar Basu at Koimoi gave the film a 1.5/5 and dubbed it as "an uninteresting plot with shabby acting & tacky humor".

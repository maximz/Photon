Michael Christopher Sheen, OBE (born 5 February 1969), is a Welsh stage and screen actor. After training at London's Royal Academy of Dramatic Art, Sheen made his professional debut in 1991, starring opposite Vanessa Redgrave in "When She Danced" at the Globe Theatre. He worked mainly in theatre throughout the 1990s and made notable stage appearances in "Romeo and Juliet" (1992), "Don’t Fool With Love" (1993), "Peer Gynt" (1994), "The Seagull" (1995), "The Homecoming" (1997) and "Henry V" (1997). His performances in "Amadeus" at the Old Vic and "Look Back in Anger" at the National Theatre were nominated for Olivier Awards in 1998 and 1999, respectively.
In the 2000s, while continuing to make sporadic stage appearances, Sheen became known primarily as a screen actor. In 2003, he was nominated for a third Olivier Award for his performance in "Caligula" at the Donmar Warehouse and had a breakthrough performance as the British politician Tony Blair in the television film "The Deal". He received a BAFTA Award nomination in 2004 for his work in the ITV drama "Dirty Filthy Love". In 2006, Sheen starred as the troubled comic actor Kenneth Williams in BBC Four's ' and came to the attention of an international audience when he reprised his role as Blair in "The Queen". Both performances were BAFTA Award-nominated. Sheen received a fourth Olivier Award nomination in 2006 for portraying the broadcaster David Frost in "Frost/Nixon" at the Donmar Warehouse and he later revisited the role of Frost in the 2008 film adaptation of the play. In 2009, Sheen appeared in two fantasy films, ' and "", and starred as the outspoken football manager Brian Clough in "The Damned United".
In the 2010s, Sheen has divided his time between film, television and theatre work. In 2010, he made a four-episode guest appearance in the NBC comedy "30 Rock" and was nominated for an Emmy Award for his portrayal of Blair in the HBO film "The Special Relationship". He appeared in the science-fiction film "" (2010) and Woody Allen's romantic comedy "Midnight in Paris" (2011). At Easter 2011, Sheen directed and starred in National Theatre Wales's "The Passion", a 72-hour secular passion play staged in his hometown of Port Talbot. From late 2011 until early 2012, Sheen played the title role in "Hamlet" at the Young Vic. In September 2013, he will star in Showtime's twelve-episode drama "Masters of Sex".
Early life.
Sheen was born in Newport, Wales, the son of Irene (née Thomas), a secretary, and Meyrick, a British Steel personnel manager. He has one younger sister, Joanne. When he was five, the family moved to Liverpool, England but settled in his parents' hometown of Baglan in Port Talbot, Wales three years later. Port Talbot is also the hometown of actors Richard Burton and Anthony Hopkins. Director Sam Mendes has described Sheen as "a stage creature" and attributed that to the actor's Welsh roots. "I'm serious. He's Welsh in the tradition of Anthony Hopkins and Richard Burton: fiery, mercurial, unpredictable." A keen footballer, Sheen was scouted and offered a place on Arsenal F.C.'s youth team at the age of 12 but his family were unwilling to relocate to London, England. He later said he was "grateful" for his parents' decision as the chances of forging a professional football career were "so slim". "It would have meant moving from Wales to London as a family. It was just too big an upheaval." He lost interest in playing football in his early teens.
Sheen was raised in a theatrical family—his parents were both involved in local amateur operatics and musicals and, later in life, his father worked as a part-time professional Jack Nicholson look-alike. In his teenage years, Sheen was involved with the West Glamorgan Youth Theatre and, later, the National Youth Theatre of Wales. "It was a brilliant youth theatre", Sheen has said, "and it taught me not only a lot about acting, but also about work ethic; it was very disciplined." He was influenced by the performances of Laurence Olivier and the writings of theatre critic Kenneth Tynan—"the combination of those two things kind of blew my head off." Sheen was educated at Blaenbaglan Primary School, Glan Afan Comprehensive School and, finally, Neath Port Talbot College where he sat A-levels in English, Drama and Sociology. He considered studying English at university but instead decided to attend drama school. He moved to London in 1988 to train as an actor at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (RADA), having spent the previous year working in a Welsh fast food restaurant called Burger Master to earn money. Sheen was granted the Laurence Olivier Bursary by The Society of London Theatre in his second year at RADA. He graduated in 1991 with a BA in Acting.
Career.
Classical stage roles (1991–2001).
Sheen worked predominantly in theatre in the 1990s and has since remarked that he will always feel "slightly more at home" on stage. "It's more of an actor's medium. You are your own editor, nobody else is choosing what is being seen of you." His first professional role, while still in his third and final year at RADA, was in "When She Danced" at the Globe Theatre in 1991. He later described the role as "a big break. One day I was at RADA doing a movement class, the next I was at a read-through with Vanessa Redgrave and Frances de la Tour." Milton Shulman of the "Evening Standard" praised an "excellent" performance while "The Observer" wrote of "a notable West End debut". In 1992, Sheen's performance in "Romeo and Juliet" at the Royal Exchange received a MEN Theatre Award nomination and led theatre critic Michael Coveney to declare him "the most exciting young actor of his generation ... a volatile, electrifying and technically fearless performer". His 1993 turn as Perdican in Alfred de Musset's "Don’t Fool With Love" at the Donmar Warehouse was nominated for the Ian Charleson Award and was described by "The Independent" as "quite thrilling". Also in 1993, Sheen appeared in the world premiere of Harold Pinter's "Moonlight" at the Almeida Theatre and made his television debut in the 1993 BBC mini-series "Gallowglass".
Sheen played the title role in "Peer Gynt" in 1994. The Yukio Ninagawa production was staged in Oslo, Tokyo and at the Barbican Centre, London. "The Times" praised Sheen's "astonishing vitality" while "The Independent" found him "sensationally good" and noted that "the Norwegian press were grudgingly captivated by the mercurial Welsh boyo". In other 1994 work, Sheen appeared in "Le Livre de Spencer" at the Odéon-Théâtre de l'Europe, Paris and starred in the cross-dressing farce "Charley's Aunt" at the Royal Exchange. In 1995, he appeared opposite Kate Beckinsale in a production of "The Seagull" at the Theatre Royal, Bath and, with the encouragement of Thelma Holt, directed and starred in "The Dresser" at the Theatre Royal, Plymouth. In addition, Sheen made his film debut that year, appearing opposite Kenneth Brannagh in "Othello". 1996 saw Sheen at the National Theatre for "The Ends of the Earth", an original play by David Lan. A minor role in "Mary Reilly" marked the first of three film collaborations with director Stephen Frears. Sheen's most significant appearance of 1997 was the title role in "Henry V", staged by the Royal Shakespeare Company (RSC) at their Stratford-upon-Avon theatre, which earned him a second Ian Charleson Award nomination. "The Times" praised "a blisteringly intelligent performance". Also in 1997, he appeared in a revival of Harold Pinter's "The Homecoming" at the National Theatre, directed by Roger Michell, and directed "Badfinger", starring Rhys Ifans, at the Donmar Warehouse. The latter was staged by the Thin Language Theatre Company, which Sheen had co-founded in 1991, aiming to further Welsh theatre. He then appeared in the biographical film "Wilde", playing Robbie Ross to Stephen Fry's Oscar Wilde. In early 1998 Sheen formed a production company, The Foundry, with Helen McCrory and Robert Delamere to promote the work of emerging playwrights, and produced "A Little World of Our Own" at the Donmar Warehouse, which gave Colin Farrell his West End debut.
From 1998 to 1999, Sheen starred as Mozart in a highly successful revival of "Amadeus". The Peter Hall-directed production was staged at the Old Vic, London and later transferred to the Music Box on Broadway. Ben Brantley, chief theatre critic for "The New York Times", was particularly vocal in his praise. He noted that "Mr. Sheen elicits a real poetry from the role" and felt that, while watching him, "you start to appreciate the derivation of the term star. This actor is so luminous it's scary!". "The Independent" found him "quite stunning as Mozart. His fantastically physical performance convinces you of his character's genius and the play catches fire whenever he's on stage." Sheen was nominated for a Laurence Olivier Award for Best Supporting Performance and an Outer Critics Circle Award for Outstanding Actor. In 1999, Sheen explored the role of Jimmy Porter in the National Theatre's production of "Look Back in Anger". In 2003, Sheen described the production as "the most enjoyable thing I've ever done ... everything came together". The "Daily Mail" declared him a "definitive Jimmy Porter... simply exhilarating in his great jazz riffs of speeches, mercurial and irresistible." "Sheen has cornered the market in explosive energy", said "The Independent", "but this thrilling performance is his finest yet." The "Financial Times" noted: "As Jimmy Porter, a role of staggering difficulty in every way, Michael Sheen gives surely the best performance London has yet seen from him ... You hang on every word he utters ... This is a dazzlingly through-the-body performance." He was nominated for a Laurence Olivier Award for Best Actor and an Evening Standard Award for Best Actor.
"The Deal", "The Queen" and "Fantabulosa" (2002–2006).
At this point in his career, Sheen began to devote more time to film work. "Heartlands", a little-seen 2002 film about a naive man's road trip in the Midlands, was his first leading film role. While "The Guardian" dismissed the "cloying bittersweet-regional-lottery-Britfilm", it noted that "Sheen himself has a childlike, Frank Spencer-ish charm". "It was great to do something that was so different", Sheen has said of the role. "I usually play very extreme characters but I couldn't get away with doing all my usual silly tricks with Colin." Also in 2002, he had a minor role in the action-adventure film "The Four Feathers". In 2003, Sheen appeared in "Bright Young Things", the directorial debut of his "Wilde" co-star, Stephen Fry. An adaptation of Evelyn Waugh's novel, the film followed high society partygoers in decadent, pre-war London. Sheen played a gay aristocrat in an ensemble cast which included James McAvoy, Emily Mortimer, David Tennant, Dan Aykroyd, Jim Broadbent and Peter O'Toole. While the "Los Angeles Times" said he "shone", "The Guardian" felt the role "drastically under-uses his talents". Sheen described his character as "possibly the campest man in cinema history" and relished a scene "where I do drugs with then 95-year-old Sir John Mills." In other 2003 film work, Sheen appeared as a werewolf named Lucian in "Underworld" and made a brief appearance in the sci-fi film "Timeline".
Sheen also returned to the stage in 2003 to play the title role in "Caligula" at the Donmar Warehouse, directed by Michael Grandage. It was the first of just three stage appearances during the 2000s; his young daughter was now based in Los Angeles, California which made more frequent stage runs in Britain impractical. "The Independent"'s critic declared it "one of the most thrilling and searching performances I have ever witnessed" while "The Daily Telegraph" described him as an "outrageously charismatic actor" with "an astonishing physical presence". "The Times" praised a "riveting performance" while "The Guardian" found him "highly impressive ... at one point he attacks his court poet with a single hair-raising leap across a chair and table". Sheen won an Evening Standard Award for Best Actor and a Critics' Circle Theatre Award for Best Actor, and was again nominated for a Laurence Olivier Award for Best Actor.
Sheen's breakthrough role was as British politician Tony Blair in 2003's "The Deal". The Channel 4 film explored the so-called Granita pact made by Tony Blair and Gordon Brown prior to the 1994 Labour Party leadership election, and was the actor's first collaboration with screenwriter Peter Morgan. Director Stephen Frears cast him because "he was in "Mary Reilly" and I knew he was brilliant." Filmed while he was playing "Caligula" nightly on stage, Sheen has remarked, "It’s interesting that in searching for monsters to play, you often end up playing leaders." "The Daily Telegraph" praised his "earnest, yet steely, portrayal" while "The Guardian" found him "excellent. This is intelligent and honest casting." In 2004, Sheen starred in ITV's "Dirty Filthy Love", a comic film about a man dealing with OCD and Tourette's after a marital separation. Sheen spoke of "treading a fine line" because "a lot of the symptoms are intrinsically comical". He was nominated for a BAFTA Award for Best Television Actor and a RTS Best Actor Award. Also in 2004, Sheen played a pompous rock star in the romantic comedy "Laws of Attraction" and produced and starred in "The Banker", which won a BAFTA Award for Best Short Film. In 2005, Sheen starred in the National Theatre's production of "The UN Inspector", a David Farr adaptation of "The Government Inspector". "The Times" wrote of "a scathingly brilliant and inventive performance" while "Variety" noted that the actor "adds comic finesse to his apparently ceaseless repertoire". "The Evening Standard", while conceding that the performance was "technically brilliant", expressed bemusement as to why "one of the most mercurial and inspiring actors we have seems set on impersonating Rik Mayall throughout". Also that year, he took part in the Old Vic's "24 Hour Play", in which "The Telegraph" felt he "dazzled". In 2005 film work, Sheen starred in "Dead Long Enough", a small-budget Welsh/Irish film, with his longtime friend, Jason Hughes. In addition, he had a supporting role in Ridley Scott's "Kingdom of Heaven", made a cameo appearance in "The League of Gentlemen's Apocalypse" and starred in the short film "The Open Doors".
Sheen came to international attention in 2006 for his portrayal of Tony Blair in "The Queen". The film focused on the differing reactions of the British Royal Family and the newly appointed Prime Minister following the death of Diana, Princess of Wales in 1997; it was Sheen's third collaboration with director Stephen Frears and his second with screenwriter Peter Morgan. He enjoyed reprising his role because Blair, at this point in his career, had "a weight to him that he didn’t have before". When asked to discuss his personal opinion of Blair, Sheen admitted that the more time he spent working on the character, the "less opinion" he has of the politician: "Now when I watch him on TV or hear his voice, it's sort of like a cross between a family member, a friend and seeing a really old embarrassing video of yourself." Peter Travers of "Rolling Stone" praised "a sensational performance, alert and nuanced" while Empire spoke of an "uncanny, insightful performance". Sheen was nominated for a BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Supporting Role. His second film appearance of 2006 was a supporting role in "Blood Diamond" as an unscrupulous diamond dealer. Also in 2006, Sheen starred as the troubled English comic actor Kenneth Williams in BBC Four's ' In preparation for the role, he lost two and a half stone, studied archival footage and read Williams' published diaries. Sheen has said he is "fascinated by finding the private side of the public face". "The Times" found his performance "mesmerising" while "The Observer" described it as "a characterisation for which the description tour-de-force is, frankly, pretty faint praise". He won a RTS Award for Best Actor, and received his second BAFTA nomination of 2006, for Best Television Actor. Sheen starred in two other BBC television productions in 2006, playing H.G. Wells in ' and Nero in "".
"Frost/Nixon" and "The Damned United" (2007–2009).
From 2006 to 2007, Sheen starred as the television broadcaster David Frost in "Frost/Nixon" at both the Donmar Warehouse and Gielgud Theatre in London and at the Jacobs Theatre on Broadway. The play, written by Peter Morgan, directed by Michael Grandage and co-starring Frank Langella, was a critical and commercial success but Sheen initially accepted the role as a favour to his friends and "never thought it was going anywhere". "The Guardian" said the actor "exactly captures Frost's verbal tics and mannerisms while suggesting a nervousness behind the self-assurance". "He’s got the voice, the mannerisms, the blaze," said the "Financial Times", "but, more than that, Sheen—as viscerally exciting an actor as any in Britain today—shows us the hunger of Frost’s ambition .. and fox-like instinct for the hunt and the kill." Sheen was nominated for a Laurence Olivier Award for Best Actor and a Drama League Award for Distinguished Performance. Sheen next appeared in the 2007 film "Music Within" as a political activist with cerebral palsy. He spoke of having a "responsibility" to accurately portray the condition. "Variety" said his performance was "remarkable.. utterly convincing", "USA Today" found him "outstanding" while the "Los Angeles Times" felt he was "reminiscent of Daniel Day-Lewis in "My Left Foot", bringing a vibrancy and wit to the role". Also that year, Sheen starred in the short film "Airlock, or How To Say Goodbye in Space" with Derek Jacobi and was invited to join the actors' branch of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts & Sciences.
Sheen revisited the role of David Frost in 2008's "Frost/Nixon", a film dramatisation of the The Nixon Interviews of 1977. Despite appearing in the original stage production in a part written for him by Peter Morgan, Sheen was surprised to have been cast in the film: "Peter said he'd only be prepared to give the rights to someone who would cast me as Frost, which was very nice, but when the studios get their hands on something... Right up until we started filming I was prepared to be disappointed". Roger Ebert of the "Chicago Sun-Times" asserted that Sheen embodied his character in a "compelling, intense" performance while "The Wall Street Journal" felt he was "a brilliant actor" who "grows his character from a bright-eyed social butterfly to a gimlet-eyed interrogator". However, "The New York Times" felt "the likable, watchable Mr. Sheen has been pitted against a scene-stealer" in Frank Langella's Nixon. Frost himself later said it was "a wonderful performance". Sheen was the recipient of the Variety Award at the British Independent Film Awards 2008.
2009 saw Sheen portray another public figure; he starred in "The Damned United" as the outspoken football manager Brian Clough. The Tom Hooper-directed film focused on Clough's disastrous 44-day tenure as manager of Leeds United and marked Sheen's fifth collaboration with writer Peter Morgan. The actor has said Clough is the real-life character he enjoyed playing most. "The Guardian", writing in 2009, declared it the "best performance of his big-screen career" while "The Times" found him "magnificent". "USA Today" praised "Sheen's masterful performance" while the "Los Angeles Times" felt he played the role with "a cheeky, dark panache" and "skillful verve". "Entertainment Weekly" asserted that, despite American audiences' unfamiliarity with Clough, "what's lost in translation is recovered easily enough in Michael Sheen's astonishing performance". "Variety" noted that his "typically scrupulous channeling of Clough gets the tics and mannerisms right, but also carves a moving portrait of a braggart suddenly out of his depth". Also in 2009, Sheen reprised his role as a werewolf in "", a prequel to the original film. Of his decision to take part, Sheen has said: "My rule of thumb is that I want to do things I'd like to go and see myself." "The New York Times" felt he was "the movie’s greatest asset ... a lively break from his usual high-crust duties to bring wit, actual acting and some unexpected musculature to the goth-horror flick". "Variety" said he hit "all the right notes in a star-powered performance that will amuse, if not amaze, anyone who only knows the actor as Tony Blair or David Frost" while Richard Corliss of "Time" noted that he "tries bravely to keep a straight face"
Sheen had a supporting role in 2009's ', the second film in the highly popular vampire series. He was paid a reported £5 million fee and director Chris Weitz has said he "aggressively" pursued the actor for the role. In its review, "Rolling Stone" said: "Late in the film, a real actor, Michael Sheen, shows up as the mind-reading Aro, of the Italian Volturi vampires, and sparks things up. You can almost hear the young cast thinking, "Is that acting? It looks hard." So Sheen is quickly ushered out." While "The New York Times" said he "preens with plausible menace", "USA Today" felt he "plays the character with more high-pitched giddiness than menace". He was named Actor of the Year at "GQ Magazines annual Men of the Year ceremony. Sheen made two once-off stage appearances in 2009; he performed a scene from "Betrayal" as part of a Harold Pinter tribute evening at the National Theatre and performed improvisational comedy as part of The Groundlings' "Crazy Joe Show" in Los Angeles.
"Hamlet" and "Masters of Sex" (2010–present).
In 2010, Sheen had a supporting role in the science fiction sequel "". Referring to his David Bowie-esque character, Sheen has said, "I was paid to show off basically". "The Wall Street Journal" found little fun in the movie "except for a gleefully campy turn by Michael Sheen" while "The New York Times" said he "shows up to deliver the closest thing to a performance in the movie". "The Daily Telegraph" felt his "lively hamming as a cane-swishing nightclub owner merely underlines how impersonal—how inhuman—much else here is". However, "USA Today" felt his "scenery-chewing performance ... is meant as comic relief, but this movie thunders along so seriously that the attempt at humor feels jarring". In other 2010 film work, Sheen provided the voices for characters in Tim Burton's "Alice in Wonderland" and Disney's "Tinker Bell and the Great Fairy Rescue" and appeared as a terrorist in "Unthinkable". On television, Sheen's performance in the third instalment of Peter Morgan's Blair trilogy, "The Special Relationship", was nominated for an Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor – Miniseries or Movie. The HBO film examined the "special relationship" between the US and the UK in the political era of Blair and Bill Clinton. It was the sixth collaboration between Sheen and Peter Morgan; both parties have since said they will not work together again "for the foreseeable future". Sheen also made a guest appearance in four episodes of NBC's "30 Rock" as Wesley Snipes, a love interest for Tina Fey's Liz Lemon. Fey, the sitcom's star and creator, has said that "he was so funny and delightful to work with". In November 2010, Sheen received the BAFTA Britannia Award for British Artist of the Year.
In 2011, Sheen starred in and was creative director of National Theatre Wales's "The Passion", a 72-hour secular passion play staged in his hometown of Port Talbot, Wales. In addition to a professional cast, over one thousand local amateurs took part in the performance and as many more volunteers from local charity and community groups were involved in preparations in the months leading up to the play. The event was the subject of both a BBC documentary and "The Gospel of Us", a film by director Dave McKean. Sheen has described it as "the most meaningful experience" of his career. "The Observer" declared it "one of the outstanding theatrical events not only of this year, but of the decade". "The Independent"'s critic described it as "the most extraordinary piece of community-specific theatre I've ever beheld". While the "The Daily Telegraph" bemoaned the large-scale production's logistical problems, "overall I found it touching, transformative and, in its own wayward way, a triumph." "The Guardian" felt it was "so much more than just an epic piece of street theatre..transforming and uplifting". Sheen and co-director Bill Mitchell were jointly honoured as Best Director at the Theatre Awards UK 2011.
Sheen's most notable film appearance of 2011 was a supporting role in Woody Allen's "Midnight in Paris". Allen noted that "Michael had to do the pseudo-intellectual, the genuine intellectual, the pedant, and he came in and nailed it from the start". Sheen enjoyed playing "someone who’s just absolutely got no sense that he’s overstepping the mark or that he’s being a bore." The film opened the 2011 Cannes Film Festival and became Allen's highest grossing film to date. Also in 2011, Sheen starred in "Beautiful Boy", an independent drama focusing on the aftermath of a school shooting, voiced the enigmatic and mysterious villain House in the "Doctor Who" episode "The Doctor's Wife" written by his friend Neil Gaiman and made cameo appearances in ' and "Resistance". In 2012 film work, Sheen starred opposite Toni Collette in the independent comedy "Jesus Henry Christ" and reprised his role as the vampire Aro in the final instalment of '.
Sheen played the title role in "Hamlet" at the Young Vic from October 2011 to January 2012, a role he first explored in a 1999 BBC Radio 3 production. While there had been tentative plans over the years for both Peter Hall and Michael Grandage to direct Sheen in the play, he eventually asked Ian Rickson. Rickson's production was set in the secure wing of a psychiatric hospital and featured original music by PJ Harvey. The "Evening Standard" declared Sheen's performance "an audacious achievement" that "will live in the memory" while "The Independent" praised "a recklessly brilliant and bravura performance." "The Telegraph" felt that Sheen "could be right up there among the great Hamlets" while "The Times" found him "unbearably moving". "The Guardian" described him as "fascinating to watch ... intelligent, inventive and full of insights ... delivers the "What a piece of work is man" passage with a beautiful consciousness of human potential." "The Observer" declared him an actor "always worth crossing a principality to see and hear" whose ""To be or not to be" is a marvel."
In March 2013, Sheen will appear in the comedy "Admission" as Tina Fey's "stiff British boyfriend". He has also filmed an appearance in an adaptation of the children's novel "Mariah Mundi & the Midas Box". In September 2013, Sheen will star in Showtime's twelve-episode drama "Masters of Sex". He and Lizzy Caplan will portray the 1960s human sexuality pioneers Masters and Johnson; the series will chronicle "their unusual lives, romance and pop culture trajectory, which saw them go from a Midwestern teaching hospital to the cover of "Time" magazine and Johnny Carson’s couch". The pilot episode was directed by John Madden. He is attached to "Cut Bank", a crime thriller co-starring Armie Hammer, Ben Kingsley, John Malkovich and Teresa Palmer.
Charity work.
Sheen is an ambassador for TREAT Trust Wales, a charity which aims to provide a rehabilitation and therapy centre in the grounds of Swansea’s Morriston Hospital by 2015, and is the Welsh ambassador of FILMCLUB, a charity which offers after-school film clubs to state primary and secondary schools in an effort to improve literacy levels. He is also an ambassador of the environmental charity Keep Wales Tidy. He is a patron of British charities including Scene & Heard, NSPCC's Child's Voice Appeal, Healing The Wounds, The Relationships Centre and WGCADA. He has taken part in a number of charity football matches, most notably captaining the winning team at Wembley Stadium. He is also a patron of the British Independent Film Awards, an ambassador for the Dylan Thomas Prize and vice-president of Port Talbot Town FC.
Personal life.
Sheen had an eight-year relationship with English actress Kate Beckinsale from 1995 until 2003. They met when cast in a touring production of "The Seagull" in early 1995 and began living together shortly afterwards. Beckinsale credited Sheen with saving her from "a hospital for the criminally insane". Their daughter, Lily Mo Sheen, was born in 1999 in London, England. The actress has said she was "embarrassed" that Sheen never proposed but felt as if she were married: "If you keep a library book out long enough, you feel it's yours." Their relationship ended in early 2003, after the filming of "Underworld". Beckinsale had persuaded director Len Wiseman to cast Sheen in the film but, while on set, she and Wiseman (who was married) fell in love. She relocated to Los Angeles, California, and married Wiseman in 2004. Sheen also moved from London to Los Angeles following the split in order to live close to his daughter. "I like LA", he has remarked. "It's grown on me and it's my home for now, but I wouldn't choose to live in LA if it wasn't for my daughter... Once Lily's older and able to move around, I'll probably return to the UK." He remains friends with both Beckinsale and Wiseman. "We were very lucky in that we didn't have an acrimonious split," Beckinsale has said. "We are still very close and daughter sees us around each other." "He's absolutely one of my most favourite people ever." "I love him dearly—I would miss him dreadfully if he wasn't in my life." Sheen has said that Beckinsale "will always be one of the most important people in my life. I have real love for her and a lot of affection for Len."
Sheen had a long-distance relationship with English ballet dancer Lorraine Stewart from late 2004 until mid-2010. He is currently in a relationship with Canadian actress Rachel McAdams, whom he met on the set of "Midnight in Paris" in July 2010.
Sheen does not adhere to any religion, having asked his parents at the age of seven if he could stop attending church. He has said that he usually votes for the Labour Party and has criticised the Conservative Party's Big Society initiative, describing it as "a totally cosmetic bit of PR". "Rather than trying to encourage people to do more voluntary work, I would say look at the people who are doing the work already and give them more support."

Other honours.
Sheen was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire in the 2009 New Year Honours list for his services to drama. He was awarded the freedom of the borough of Neath Port Talbot, Wales in 2008 for his services in the field of the dramatic arts.

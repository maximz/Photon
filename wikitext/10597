His next role was in 2007's "The Lookout", in which he played Chris Pratt, a janitor involved in a bank heist. In reviewing the film, "The Philadelphia Inquirer" described Gordon-Levitt as a "surprisingly formidable, and formidably surprising, leading man", while "New York" magazine stated that he is a "major tabula rasa actor ... a minimalist", and that his character worked because he "doesn't seize the space ... by what he takes away from the character."

His performance, described as "the real key" to what makes the film work, credits him with using "his usual spell in subtle gradations."

He was subsequently nominated for a Golden Globe Award.

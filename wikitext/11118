Overview and production.
The series stars Dana Delany as Dr. Megan Hunt, a medical examiner. The show focuses on Hunt's efforts to balance the demands of her professional life, dealing with solving cases and analyzing bodies, with her personal life, trying to reconnect with her estranged daughter. Hunt was a top-flight neurosurgeon, until she had a life-changing automobile accident and then accidentally killed a patient on the operating table. This resulted in her resignation, and retirement from the profession altogether. Though set in Philadelphia, the first season of "Body of Proof" was filmed in Providence, Rhode Island and some other locations including Woonsocket and Warwick, Rhode Island. The series was originally titled "Body of Evidence" but was later renamed "Body of Proof". It was announced that the second season of the show would be filmed in Los Angeles to take advantage of a $7 million tax credit. "Body of Proof" is the third ABC television series starring Dana Delany in a main character role, the first being the role of Colleen McMurphy in "China Beach" and the second being Katherine Mayfair in "Desperate Housewives".
While filming, real life technical advisers make sure that the procedures are correct. Jeri Ryan said, "We've got technical advisers that will be with us on set, so we can keep all of science realistic".

Reception.
Critical reception.
The show was met with mixed reviews: Metacritic summarizes the opinions of 21 critics in giving the show's first season a score of 56 out of 100. "Entertainment Weekly" included the show in the 10 TV events to look forward to in 2011. Critic David Hinckley from the New York "Daily News" gave the show a positive review, noting it "would be interesting enough if it were just "Quincy" with better legs. Add the other elements and you have something worth checking out at 10 o'clock". Other reviews have been more negative, commenting on the clichéd plot and character development. "Las Vegas Weekly" critic Josh Bell commented that "The problem is that Megan’s personal issues are as clichéd and clumsily presented as her boilerplate murder cases, and the show makes strained connections between the two that don’t really hold together." "The Detroit News" called it "Saggy, predictable and preachy, the series debut was delayed for months and still doesn't have what it takes to impress viewers. What a poor replacement for "Detroit 1-8-7" (Ironically, "Detroit 1–8–7" was cancelled and "Body of Proof" was renewed)." The "Los Angeles Times" said "Murphey and the writers will have to do a lot of heavy lifting for "Body of Proof" to transcend its immediate predictability. There's only so much Delany can do with a cardboard show. God may be in the details, but the walls still have to hold."

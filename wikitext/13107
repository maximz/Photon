"I can't change the past and I'm truly sorry that people got hurt along the way but not everything reported in the media is reality and continuing to rehash things publicly only makes it more difficult for everyone to heal. I hope for the sake of our children we can all move forward and heal privately. I wish their mother nothing but the best."

As Scheana works as a server at restaurants owned by Glanville's friend Lisa Vanderpump, her affair with Cibrian has become a plot point in two Bravo TV reality shows in which Vanderpump stars and Scheana appears as a waitress: "The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills" (episode 2.19, "Night of a Thousand Surprises", airdate January 16, 2012, and multiple episodes of season 3) and "Vanderpump Rules" (season 1).

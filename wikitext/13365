The album's eponymous leadoff single, "Blue", became a Top 10 hit and Rimes gained national acclaim for her similarity to Patsy Cline's vocal style. When she released her sophomore studio effort in 1997, "", she moved towards country pop material, which set the trend for a string of albums released into the next decade.

Early life.
Margaret LeAnn Rimes was born in Jackson, Mississippi. She is the only child of Belinda (née Butler) Rimes and Wilbur Rimes. The family relocated to Garland, Texas when she was six years old. She was singing by the age of two, was enrolled in vocal and dance training, and by the age of five was performing at local talent shows. 
Rimes initially began her career in musical theatre, performing in a Dallas, Texas production of "A Christmas Carol", and almost landed the lead part in the Broadway production of "Annie". However, after appearing on the network television competition show "Star Search", where she clearly charmed host Ed McMahon in addition to the more important fact of being a one-week champion on the show, Rimes decided to pursue a career in country music. Following her national television appearance, Rimes made a number of appearances on "Johnnie High's Country Music Revue" in Arlington, Texas, which garnered the attention of national talent scouts.
By the age of nine, Rimes was already an experienced singer. She toured nationally with her father and also regularly performed a cappella renditions of "The Star Spangled Banner" at the opening ceremonies of the Dallas Cowboys football games. In order to bring his daughter more national attention, Wilbur Rimes began recording his daughter under the independent label Nor Va Jak when she turned eleven. She released three albums under the label between 1991 and 1996.
Rimes was discovered by Dallas disc jockey and record promoter Bill Mack. Mack was impressed by Rimes's vocal ability, and over the following three years, he made various attempts to bring Rimes to a mainstream level. The center of Mack's plan to bring her success was his self-penned composition, "Blue", which Mack claimed he intended to be recorded and made into a hit record by Patsy Cline, but she had been killed in a plane crash before ever recording the composition. In July 1994, Rimes recorded the song on her independent album, "All That".
Music career.
1996: "Blue".
After signing with Curb, Rimes re-recorded a new version of "Blue" that was released on her debut studio album, and as a single which peaked at number ten on the "Billboard" Country Chart.
During this time the media was reporting that Rimes was the successor to Patsy Cline's legacy.
The album "Blue" sold 123,000 copies in its first week, the highest figure in SoundScan history at that time. It peaked at number one on the Top Country Albums and debuted at number three on the "Billboard" 200 albums chart, eventually selling a total of four million copies in the United States and eight million copies worldwide.
Allmusic considered the album to be "delightful" and that it could "help inspire other young teens".
Rimes followed up the single with several charting country singles from her 1996 album, starting with "One Way Ticket (Because I Can)", which reached number one on the "Billboard" Country Chart in 1996. She also released a duet single with Eddy Arnold from the album, a remake of his 1955 hit "The Cattle Call". 
The album's other hits included the Top 5 "The Light in Your Eyes" and the minor hit "Hurt Me".
With the album's success, Rimes received many major industry awards. In 1997 at 14 years old she became the youngest person to win a Grammy, for "Best New Artist" and "Best Female Country Vocal Performance" for "Blue". She was also the first Country music artist to win the Best New Artist category. The same year she won the Country Music Association's "Horizon Award" for Best New Artist Of The Year, becoming the youngest person to ever be nominated and win a Country Music Association award.
1997–2001: Pop crossover and worldwide success.
In 1997, Rimes released a compilation of previously recorded material under the Nor Va Jak label, "". The album mainly consisted of cover versions, ranging from Country to pop covers, including songs originally recorded by The Beatles, Whitney Houston, Bill Monroe, and Dolly Parton.
Rimes's version of the title track became a major country hit in early 1997 and helped increase sales for the album. In June 1997, Rimes would appear on the Disney Channel for television special called "LeAnn Rimes in Concert".
In September 1997, Rimes released her follow-up studio album to "Blue" titled "". The album covered classic inspirational songs, such as "Clinging to Saving a Hand" and "Amazing Grace". It also featured pop music remakes of songs such as Debby Boone's "You Light Up My Life" and Bette Midler's "The Rose". The album was a departure from Rimes's previous releases as it contained more Adult Contemporary-styled music than Country.
The album sold over four million copies in the United States, certifying 4× Multi-Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America.
The album contained an extended version of the single "How Do I Live", which became a major pop hit on the "Billboard" Hot 100, reaching number two.

It also included a remake of Prince's "Purple Rain" and was produced by her father. The album was given mixed reviews. Allmusic gave the album two out of five stars.
"Rolling Stone" said Rimes vocal style "holds her own in the more popular style of Mariah Carey and Celine Dion, wherein a spectacular voice upstages a song, grins and goes on about her business."
Upon its release, "Sittin' on Top of the World" debuted at number two on the Top Country Albums chart, and number three on the "Billboard" 200,
and sold over a million copies in the United States, certifying "Platinum" in sales by the RIAA.

The album also covered Marty Robbins's "Don't Worry" and Kris Kristofferson's "Me and Bobby McGee". The album included one new song, "Big Deal". The song gained many positive reviews. Allmusic called the song, "a return to her roots" and "a salute to one of her idols, Patsy Cline." The album in general received much praise. Allmusic called the album one of her "better" efforts, since they had disliked her previous releases.
"Entertainment Weekly" gave the album a positive review and said that Rimes's voice, "dares listeners to take note of what is missing in her interpretations -- the gutsiness and gut-wrenching urgency of performers who felt what they sang."
The album was a major success like her previous releases, debuting at number one on the Top Country Albums chart, topping the country albums chart for two weeks. In addition, it also peaked at number eight on the "Billboard" 200 albums chart.
The album also sold over one million copies in the United States, and was certified "Platinum" in sales by the RIAA.
The album's new song, "Big Deal", was the lead single off the album, and became a Top 10 country hit that year, peaking at number six.
Also in 1999, Rimes recorded a duet with Elton John for the stage musical "Aida", titled "Written in the Stars".
The song became a Top 40 hit on the "Billboard" Hot 100. The album would spawn a second single, a cover of Cline's "Crazy" that was released outside of the United States. 
In 2000, Rimes would make her full crossover into pop music. On March 8, 2000, Rimes contributed to the soundtrack from the 1999 TV movie "Jesus", called "Jesus: Music From & Inspired by the Epic Mini Series". The song, "I Need You", would be released as a single from the soundtrack on July 18, 2000. "I Need You" was characterized by Allmusic as having similarities to that of Adult Contemporary and Pop music. The song became a Top 10 country hit and also a major pop hit, reaching number eleven on the Hot 100. Rimes would make her first theatrical acting debut in the 2000 film "Coyote Ugly".

The album topped the Top Country Albums chart for one week, and also peaked at number ten on the "Billboard" 200. "I Need You" did not garner praise from many critics and was mainly given negative reviews. "Rolling Stone" gave the album two and a half out of five stars and called the album, "synthetic-feeling." Despite very little praise from critics, the album was sold well, and was certified "Gold" in sales by the RIAA. Rimes would later go on to publicly disown the album, which she stated was compiled together from studio outtakes her father had produced and that it was released without her knowledge or input. At the time, during the litigation with her label, Rimes was asking that her label, Curb, give her the rights to all past recordings and videos, give up all publishing interests in her compositions and destroy all currently available recordings."

Musicianship.
Vocal ability and musical stylings.
Since her debut in 1996, Rimes's soprano voice and vocal style have often been compared to and identified with Patsy Cline. Cline showed distinctive emotional expression in most of her material. Rimes has also used distinctive emotional expression in many of her songs, most notably her first single, "Blue", which was sung in the style of Cline. Rimes's vocal similarities to Cline had brought wide interest to the idea that Rimes was the successor to Cline's legacy, and brought her novelty appeal. Many music critics have argued that Rimes's vocals were only a reproduction of Cline's original sound, while others have disagreed.
Allmusic has called Rimes's vocals "rich and powerful."
Her vocal ability has also brought Rimes to comparisons to past teenage country stars, including 50s country star Brenda Lee and 70s country star Tanya Tucker. Rimes was also known for choosing mature material that was beyond her age range. In her first album, Rimes recorded such material as Deborah Allen's "My Baby", whose lyrics provocatively say, "my baby is a full-time lover, my baby is a full-grown man."
Other material such as Diane Warren's "How Do I Live" had also been considered too mature for Rimes's age and was the main reason why her version of the song was not chosen to be used in the soundtrack for the film "Con Air". Rimes also has a vocal range that goes from D3 to Eb6 which is just a little over three octaves.
Influences.
Rimes has given credit to artists from various music genres, mainly country and pop. She has stated that Barbra Streisand, Wynonna Judd and Reba McEntire were primary influences on her career.
Rimes has said the main influence on her career was Patsy Cline. She has covered many of Cline's hit songs since the beginning of her career. Her 1999 self-titled album is primarily a tribute to Cline, as Rimes recorded five out of ten songs for the album that were hits for Cline years before. Rimes has also stated that Judy Garland was an influence as well.
Film and television.
After beginning to date actor Andrew Keegan in 1998, Rimes said to the press that she had some ideas about possibly getting involved in an acting career. Rimes later moved to Los Angeles, California later in the year with her mother to pursue an acting career.
That year Rimes played a role in the Made for television movie, "Holiday in Your Heart," which is based on a book she had helped write. For participating in the film, Rimes was awarded the "Rising Star" award from the "Lone Star Film & Television Awards."
She made her official film debut in 2000 for "Coyote Ugly", providing the singing voice for Piper Perabo's character Violet Sanford and making a cameo appearance towards the end of the film. In addition, she also recorded four songs for the film's soundtrack, including the Top 20 Pop hit, "Can't Fight the Moonlight."
In 2005 Rimes hosted the country music television competition, "Nashville Star" on the USA television network. However she only held the position for one season after deciding to depart from the show's cast.
In early June 2007, she was chosen at the last minute to record the leading song for the soundtrack of "Evan Almighty" called "Ready For A Miracle" (previously recorded by Patti LaBelle). The song can be heard in the movie, during the end credits, and in the trailers of "Evan Almighty."
Rimes played in the movie "Good Intentions" with her friend Elaine Hendricks which is filming near Atlanta, Georgia.
Rimes plays Meg Galligan in the made for TV movie, "Northern Lights", based on the Nora Roberts novel of the same name. The film aired on the Lifetime network on March 12, 2009.

Personal life.
Lawsuits.
On May 21, 2000, Rimes filed a lawsuit against her father, Wilbur Rimes, and her former manager, Lyle Walker in Dallas, Texas. Rimes claimed that her father and former manager took over seven million dollars from her in the preceding five years. Rimes also alleged that both men made unreasonable fees and took advantage of Rimes's label, Asylum-Curb, in order to acquire financial gain. Rimes sought unspecified damages because her attorney was not sure of how much money had been lost in the preceding five years. According to Rimes's lawyer, her mother hired two accountants to investigate how much was taken from Rimes's fortune, and it was estimated that the men acquired around eight million dollars in royalties. In 2002, Rimes's lawsuit with her father was "settled on undisclosed terms."
Rimes reconciled with her father for her wedding.
In November 2000, Rimes filed a second lawsuit against her label, Asylum-Curb. Rimes wanted permission to be released from the contract that was signed by her parents on Rimes's behalf when she originally signed with the label in 1995. She also wanted her label to turn over the rights of her music, video work, and publishing interests, and destroy all of her recordings that were currently available to the label at the time of the lawsuit. Part of Rimes's legal battles ended in December 2001, when Asylum-Curb started a new contract with Rimes.
Marriages.
Amid the legal battles, Rimes fell in love with backup dancer Dean Sheremet. The two had met when he was chosen to dance during Rimes's hosting of the 2001 Academy of Country Music Awards. After her first date with Sheremet, Rimes told "InStyle Magazine": "This is the guy I want to marry". The couple married the next year, in 2002. In July 2009, the couple separated and in September 2009, Rimes announced their plans to divorce. The divorce was finalized on June 19, 2010, exactly six months after Sheremet filed divorce documents for dissolution of marriage.
While still married to Sheremet, Rimes had an affair in 2009 with actor Eddie Cibrian, while both co-starred in "Northern Lights" (a "Lifetime" made-for-TV film); it was discovered and made public by multiple tabloid/celebrity-news outlets. Cibrian left his wife Brandi Glanville, the mother of his two children, for Rimes. He filed for divorce in August 2009 after eight years of marriage. In June 2010, Rimes spoke for the first time about the end of her first marriage, stating, "I take responsibility for everything I've done. I hate that people got hurt...But I don't regret the outcome". On December 27, 2010, it was announced via "Billboard" that Rimes and Cibrian were engaged. Rimes and Cibrian wed on April 22, 2011 at a private home in California.

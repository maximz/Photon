The sixth season of the American sitcom "The Big Bang Theory" aired on CBS from September 27, 2012. Series creator Bill Prady stated that the writers would start back writing season 6 in mid-June 2012 and filming of season 6 would begin on August 14, 2012. On May 10, 2012, Prady stated that "not all the characters will be in California when 6 begins". The series' season premieres have typically been set immediately following the events of the preceding season finales, and Howard is being launched from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan to the International Space Station at the end of season 5.
On August 22, 2012, it was announced that Kevin Sussman, who plays Stuart, the comic book store owner, has been promoted to series regular.
The series crossed the 20 million viewer mark for the first time with this season's "The Bakersfield Expedition", which along with "NCIS", made CBS the first network to have two scripted series reach that large an audience in the same week since 2007. This success has been attributed to the sitcom's exposure in syndication, its late 2010 move to the Thursday 8:00pm ET timeslot, and the influence of showrunner Steve Molaro (who took over from Bill Prady) on the characters' storylines.

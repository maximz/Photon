James Francis Cameron (born August 16, 1954) is a Canadian film director, film producer, deep-sea explorer, screenwriter, visual artist and editor. His writing and directing work includes "The Terminator" (1984), "Aliens" (1986), "The Abyss" (1989), "" (1991), "True Lies" (1994), "Titanic" (1997), "Dark Angel" (2000–02), and "Avatar" (2009). In the time between making "Titanic" and "Avatar", Cameron spent several years creating many documentary films (specifically underwater documentaries) and co-developed the digital 3D Fusion Camera System. Described by a biographer as part-scientist and part-artist, Cameron has also contributed to underwater filming and remote vehicle technologies. On March 26, 2012, Cameron reached the bottom of the Mariana Trench, the deepest part of the ocean, in the "Deepsea Challenger" submersible. He was the first person to do this in a solo descent, and only the third person to do so ever.
He has been nominated for six Academy Awards overall and won three for "Titanic". In total, Cameron's directorial efforts have grossed approximately US$2 billion in North America and US$6 billion worldwide. Not adjusted for inflation, Cameron's "Titanic" and "Avatar" are the two highest-grossing films of all time at $2.19 billion and $2.78 billion respectively. In March 2011 he was named Hollywood's top earner by "Vanity Fair", with estimated 2010 earnings of $257 million.
Background.
Cameron was born in Kapuskasing, Ontario, Canada, in 1954, the son of Shirley (née Lowe), an artist and nurse, and Phillip Cameron. His paternal great-great-great-grandfather emigrated from Balquhidder, Scotland in 1825; thus, he descends from Clan Cameron.
Cameron grew up in Chippawa, Ontario, with his only brother Mike. He attended Stamford Collegiate School in Niagara Falls, Ontario. In 1971, his family moved to Brea, California, when Cameron was 17 years old. Cameron enrolled at Fullerton College, a 2-year community college, in 1973 to study physics. He switched to English, then dropped out before the start of the fall 1974 semester.
After dropping out of Sonora High School, he went to further his secondary education at Brea Olinda High School. After graduating, he worked several jobs such as truck driving and wrote when he had time. During this period he taught himself about special effects: "I'd go down to the USC library and pull any thesis that graduate students had written about optical printing, or front screen projection, or dye transfers, anything that related to film technology. That way I could sit down and read it, and if they'd let me photocopy it, I would. If not, I'd make notes."
After seeing the original "" film in 1977, Cameron quit his job as a truck driver to enter the film industry. When Cameron read Syd Field's book "Screenplay", it occurred to him that integrating science and art was possible, and he wrote a ten-minute science fiction script with two friends, entitled "Xenogenesis". They raised money and rented camera, lenses, film stock, and studio, and shot it in 35mm. To understand how to operate the camera, they dismantled it and spent the first half-day of the shoot trying to figure out how to get it running.
Early career.
His first film he created was called Xenogenesis 1978. He was the director, writer, producer, and production designer for Xenogenesis. He then became a production assistant on a film called "Rock and Roll High School", uncredited in 1979. While continuing to educate himself in film-making techniques, Cameron started working as a miniature-model maker at Roger Corman Studios. Making rapidly produced, low-budget productions taught Cameron to work efficiently and effectively. He soon found employment as an art director in the sci-fi movie "Battle Beyond the Stars" (1980). He did special effects work design and direction on John Carpenter's "Escape from New York" (1981), acted as production designer on "Galaxy of Terror" (1981), and consulted on the design of "Android" (1982).
Cameron was hired as the special effects director for the sequel of "Piranha", entitled "" in 1981. The original director, Miller Drake, left the project due to creative differences with Ovidio Assonitis. Cameron was hired by Assonitis, giving him his first directorial job. The interior scenes were filmed in Italy while the underwater sequences were shot at Grand Cayman Island.
The movie was to be produced in Jamaica. On location, production slowed due to numerous problems and adverse weather. James Cameron was fired after failing to get a close up of Carole Davis in her opening scene. Ovidio ordered Cameron to do the close-up the next day before he started on that day’s shooting. Cameron spent the entire day sailing around the resort to reproduce the lighting but still failed to get the close-up. After he was fired, Ovidio invited Cameron to stay on location and assist in the shooting. Once in Rome, Ovidio took over the editing when Cameron was stricken with food poisoning. During his illness, he had a nightmare about an invincible robot hitman sent from the future to kill him, giving him the idea for "The Terminator", which later catapulted his film career.
Major films.
"The Terminator" (1984).
After completing a screenplay for "The Terminator", Cameron decided to sell it so that he could direct the movie. However, the production companies he contacted, while expressing interest in the project, were unwilling to let a largely inexperienced feature film director make the movie. Finally, Cameron found a company called Hemdale Pictures, which was willing to let him direct. Gale Anne Hurd, who had started her own production company, Pacific Western Productions, had previously worked with Cameron in Roger Corman's company and agreed to buy Cameron's screenplay for one dollar, on the condition that Cameron direct the film. Hurd was signed on as producer, and Cameron finally got his first break as director. Orion Pictures distributed the film.
Initially, for the role of the Terminator, Cameron wanted someone who wasn't exceptionally muscular, and who could "blend into" a normal crowd. Lance Henriksen, who had starred in "Piranha II: The Spawning", was considered for the title role, but when Arnold Schwarzenegger and Cameron first met over lunch to discuss Schwarzenegger playing the role of Kyle Reese, both came to the conclusion that the cyborg villain would be the more compelling role for the Austrian bodybuilder; Henriksen got the smaller part of LAPD detective Hal Vukovich and the role of Kyle Reese went to Michael Biehn. In addition, Linda Hamilton first appeared in this film in her iconic role of Sarah Connor, and later married Cameron.
"The Terminator" was a box office hit, breaking expectations by Orion Pictures executives that the film would be regarded as no more than a sci-fi film, and only last a week in theaters. It was a low-budget film which cost $6.5 million to make, cutting expenses in such ways as recording the audio track in mono. However, "The Terminator" eventually earned over $78 million worldwide.
"Rambo: First Blood Part II" (1985).
During the early 1980s, Cameron wrote three screenplays simultaneously: "The Terminator", "Aliens", and the first draft of '. While Cameron continued with "The Terminator" and "Aliens", Sylvester Stallone eventually took over the script of ', creating a final draft which differed radically from Cameron's initial vision.
"Aliens" (1986).
Cameron next began the sequel to "Alien", the 1979 film by Ridley Scott. Cameron named the sequel "Aliens", and again cast Sigourney Weaver in the iconic role of Ellen Ripley. According to Cameron, the crew on "Aliens" was hostile to him, regarding him as a poor substitute for Ridley Scott. Cameron sought to show them "The Terminator" but the majority of the crew refused to watch it and remained skeptical of his direction throughout production. Despite this and other off-screen problems (such as clashing with an uncooperative camera man and having to replace one of the lead actors – Michael Biehn of "Terminator" took James Remar's place as Corporal Hicks), it is often argued that Aliens is the superior film in the in Alien franchise. "Aliens" became a box office success, and received Academy Award nominations for Best Actress in a Leading Role for Weaver, Best Art Direction, Best Film Editing, Best Original Score, Best Sound, and won awards for Best Sound Effects Editing and Best Visual Effects. In addition, the film and its lead actress made the cover of "TIME" magazine as a result of its numerous and extensive scenes of women in combat - these were almost without precedent and expressed the feminist theme of the film very strongly.
"The Abyss" (1989).
Cameron's next project stemmed from an idea that had come up during a high school biology class. The story of oil-rig workers who discover otherworldly underwater creatures became the basis of Cameron's screenplay for "The Abyss", which cast Ed Harris, Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio and Michael Biehn. Initially budgeted at $41 million U.S. (though the production ran considerably over budget), it was considered to be one of the most expensive films of its time, and required cutting-edge effects technology. Because much of the film takes place underwater and the technology wasn't advanced enough to digitally create an underwater environment, Cameron chose to shoot much of the movie "reel-for-real", at depths of up to . For creation of the sets, the containment building of an unfinished nuclear power plant was converted, and two huge tanks were used. The main tank was filled with of water, and the second with . The cast and crew resided there for much of the shooting.
"Terminator 2: Judgment Day" (1991).
After the success of "The Terminator", there had always been talks about a sequel to continue the story of Sarah Connor and her struggle against machines from the future. Although Cameron had come up with a core idea for the sequel, and Schwarzenegger expressed interest in continuing the story, there were still problems regarding who had the rights to the story, as well as the logistics of the special effects needed to make the sequel. Finally, in late-1980s, Mario Kassar of Carolco Pictures secured the rights to the sequel, allowing Cameron to greenlight production of the film, now called "".
For the film, Linda Hamilton reprised her iconic role of Sarah Connor. In addition, Schwarzenegger also returned in his role as The Terminator, but this time as a protector. Unlike Schwarzenegger's character—the T-800 Terminator which is made of a metal endoskeleton—the new villain of the sequel, called the T-1000, is a more-advanced Terminator made of liquid metal, and with polymorphic abilities. The T-1000 would also be much less bulky than the T-800. For the role, Cameron cast Robert Patrick, a sharp contrast to Schwarzenegger. Cameron explained, "I wanted someone who was extremely fast and agile. If the T-800 is a human Panzer tank, then the T-1000 is a Porsche."
Cameron had originally wanted to incorporate this advanced-model Terminator into the first film, but the special effects at the time were not advanced enough. The ground-breaking effects used in "The Abyss" to digitally depict the water tentacle convinced Cameron that his liquid metal villain was now possible.
TriStar Pictures agreed to distribute the film, but under a locked release date only about one year after the start of shooting. The movie, co-written by Cameron and his longtime friend, William Wisher, Jr., had to go from screenplay to finished film in just that amount of time. Like Cameron's previous film, it was one of the most expensive films of its era, with a budget of about $100 million. The biggest challenge of the movie was the special effects used in creating the T-1000. Nevertheless, the film was finished on time, and released to theaters on July 3, 1991.
"Terminator 2", or "T2", as it was abbreviated, broke box-office records (including the opening weekend record for an R-rated film), earning over $200 million in the United States and Canada, and over $300 million in other territories, and became the highest-grossing film of that year. It won four Academy Awards: Best Makeup, Best Sound, Best Sound Effects Editing, and Best Visual Effects. It was also nominated for Best Cinematography and Best Film Editing, but lost both Awards to "JFK".
James Cameron announced a third "Terminator" film many times during the 1990s, but without coming out with any finished scripts. Kassar and Vajna purchased the rights to the Terminator franchise from a bankruptcy sale of Carolco's assets. "" was eventually made and released in July 2003 without Cameron's involvement. Jonathan Mostow directed the film and Schwarzenegger returned as the Terminator.
Cameron reunited with the main cast of "Terminator 2" to film "", an attraction at Universal Studios Florida, Universal Studios Hollywood and Universal Studios Japan. It was released in 1996 and was a mini-sequel to "Terminator 2: Judgment Day". The show is in two parts: a prequel segment in which a spokesperson talks about Cyberdyne, and a main feature, in which the performers interact with a 3-D movie.
"True Lies" (1994).
Before the release of "T2", Schwarzenegger came to Cameron with the idea of remaking the French comedy "La Totale!" Titled "True Lies", with filming beginning after "T2"'s release, the story revolves around a secret-agent spy who leads a double life as a married man, whose wife believes he is a computer salesman. Schwarzenegger was cast as Harry Tasker, a spy charged with stopping a plan by a terrorist to use nuclear weapons against the United States. Jamie Lee Curtis and Eliza Dushku played the character's family, and Tom Arnold the sidekick.
Cameron's "Lightstorm Entertainment" signed on with Twentieth Century Fox for production of "True Lies". Made on a budget of $115 million and released in 1994, the film earned $146 million in North America, and $232 million abroad. The film received an Academy Award nomination for Best Visual Effects.
"Titanic" (1997).
Cameron expressed interest in the famous sinking of the ship . He decided to script and film his next project based on this event. The picture revolved around a fictional romance story between two young lovers from different social classes who meet on board. Before production began, he took dives to the bottom of the Atlantic and shot actual footage of the ship underwater, which he inserted into the final film. Much of the film's dialogue was also written during these dives.
Subsequently, Cameron cast Leonardo DiCaprio, Kate Winslet, Billy Zane, Kathy Bates, Frances Fisher, Gloria Stuart, Bernard Hill, Jonathan Hyde, Victor Garber, Danny Nucci, David Warner, Suzy Amis, and Bill Paxton as the film's principal cast. Cameron's budget for the film reached about $200 million, making it the most expensive movie ever made at the time. Before its release, the film was widely ridiculed for its expense and protracted production schedule.
Released to theaters on December 19, 1997, "Titanic" grossed less in its first weekend ($28.6 million) than in its second, ($35.4 million), an increase of 23.8%. This is unheard of for a widely released film, which is a testament to the movie's appeal. This was especially noteworthy, considering that the film's running time of more than three hours limited the number of showings each theater could schedule. It held the No. 1 spot on the box-office charts for months, eventually grossing a total of $600.8 million in the United States and Canada and more than $1.84 billion worldwide. "Titanic" became the highest-grossing film of all time and in the United States and Canada, and the first film to gross more than $1 billion worldwide. It remained the highest-grossing film since 1998, until Cameron's 2009 film "Avatar" surpassed its gross in 2010.
The CG visuals surrounding the sinking and destruction of the ship were considered spectacular. Despite criticism during production of the film, it received a record-tying 14 Oscar nominations (tied with "All About Eve") at the 1998 Academy Awards. It won 11 Oscars (also tying the record for most Oscar wins with "Ben-Hur" and later ""), including: Best Picture, Best Director, Best Art Direction, Best Cinematography, Best Visual Effects, Best Film Editing, Best Costume Design, Best Sound, Best Sound Effects Editing, Best Original Dramatic Score, Best Original Song. Upon receiving the Best Director Oscar, Cameron exclaimed, "I'm king of the world!", in reference to one of the main characters' lines from the film. After receiving the Best Picture Oscar along with Jon Landau, Cameron asked for a moment of silence for the 1500 men, women and children, who died when the ship sank. 
In March 2010, Cameron revealed that "Titanic" would be re-released in 3D in April 2012, to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the sinking of the real ship. Following the re-release, "Titanic's" domestic total was pushed to $658.6 million and more than $2.18 billion worldwide. It became the second film gross more than $2 billion worldwide (the first being Avatar).
"Spider-Man" and "Dark Angel" (2000–2002).
Cameron had initially next planned to do a film of the comic book character Spider-Man, a project developed by Menahem Golan of Cannon Films. Columbia hired David Koepp to adapt Cameron's treatment into a screenplay, and Koepp's first draft is taken often word-for-word from Cameron's story, though later drafts were heavily rewritten by Koepp himself, Scott Rosenberg, and Alvin Sargent. Columbia preferred to credit David Koepp solely, and none of the scripts before or after his were ever examined by the Writers Guild of America, East to determine proper credit attribution. Cameron and other writers objected, but Columbia and the WGA prevailed. In its release in 2002, "Spider-Man" had its screenplay credited solely to Koepp.
Unable to make "Spider-Man", Cameron moved to television and created "Dark Angel", a superheroine-centered series influenced by cyberpunk, biopunk, contemporary superhero franchises, and third-wave feminism. Co-produced with Charles H. Eglee, "Dark Angel" starred Jessica Alba as Max Guevara, a genetically enhanced transgenic super-soldier created by a secretive organization. Cameron's work was said to "bring empowered female warriors back to television screens[...] by mixing the sober feminism of his "The Terminator" and "Aliens" characters with the sexed-up Girl Power of a Britney Spears concert." While a success in its first season, low ratings in the second led to its cancellation. Cameron himself directed the series finale, a two-hour episode wrapping up many of the series' loose ends.
Documentaries (2002–2012).
In 1998 James and John David Cameron formed a digital media company, earthship.tv, which became Earthship Productions. The company produced live multimedia documentaries from the depths of the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. With Earthship Productions, John Cameron's recent projects have included undersea documentaries on the ("", 2002) and the "Titanic" ("Ghosts of the Abyss" (2003, in IMAX 3D) and "Tony Robinson's Titanic Adventure" (2005)). He was a producer on the 2002 film "Solaris", and narrated "The Exodus Decoded".
Cameron is a leading advocate for stereoscopic digital 3-D films. In a 2003 interview about his IMAX 2D documentary "Ghosts of the Abyss", he mentioned that he is "going to do everything in 3D now". He has made similar statements in other interviews. "Ghosts of the Abyss" and "Aliens of the Deep" (also an IMAX documentary) were both shot in 3-D and released by Walt Disney Pictures and Walden Media, and Cameron did the same for his new project, "Avatar" for 20th Century Fox & Sony Pictures' Columbia Pictures. He intends to use the same technology for "The Dive", "Sanctum" and an adaptation of the manga series "Battle Angel Alita".
Cameron was the founder and CEO of Digital Domain, a visual effects production and technology company.
In addition, he plans to create a 3-D project about the first trip to Mars. ("I've been very interested in the Humans to Mars movement—the 'Mars Underground'—and I've done a tremendous amount of personal research for a novel, a miniseries, and a 3-D film.") He is on the science team for the 2011 Mars Science Laboratory.
Cameron announced on February 26, 2007, that he, along with his director, Simcha Jacobovici, have documented the unearthing of the Talpiot Tomb, which is alleged to be the tomb of Jesus. Unearthed in 1981 by Israeli construction workers, the names on the tomb are claimed, in the documentary, to correlate with the names of Jesus and several individuals closely associated with him. Scientists pictured in the feature further claim to have DNA tests, archaeological evidence, and Biblical studies to back up their claim. The documentary, named "The Lost Tomb of Jesus", was broadcast on the Discovery Channel on March 4, 2007.
As a National Geographic explorer-in-residence, Cameron re-investigated the sinking of the "Titanic" with eight experts in 2012. The investigation was featured in the TV documentary special "Titanic: The Final Word with James Cameron", which premiered on April 8 on the National Geographic Channel. In the conclusion of the analysis, the consensus revised the CGI animation of the sinking conceived in 1995.
"Avatar" (2009).
In June 2005, Cameron was announced to be working on a project tentatively titled "Project 880" (now known to be "Avatar") in parallel with another project, "Battle Angel" (an adaptation of the manga series Battle Angel Alita). Both movies were to be shot in 3D. By December, Cameron stated that he wanted to film "Battle Angel" first, followed by "Avatar". However in February 2006, he switched goals for the two film projects and decided to film "Avatar" first. He mentioned that if both films are successful, he would be interested in seeing a trilogy being made for both.
"Avatar" had an estimated budget of over $300 million and was released on December 18, 2009. This marked his first feature film since 1997's "Titanic". It is composed almost entirely of computer-generated animation, using a more advanced version of the "performance capture" technique used by director Robert Zemeckis in "The Polar Express". James Cameron had written an 80 page scriptment for "Avatar" in 1995 and announced in 1996 that he would make the film after completing "Titanic". In December 2006, Cameron explained that the delay in producing the film since the 1990s had been to wait until the technology necessary to create his project was advanced enough. The film was originally scheduled to be released in May 2009 but was pushed back to December 2009 to allow more time for post-production on the complex CGI and to give more time for theatres worldwide to install 3D projectors. Cameron originally intended "Avatar" to be 3D-only. 
"Avatar" broke several Box Office records during its initial theatrical run. It grossed $749.7 million in the United States and Canada and more than $2.74 billion worldwide, to become the highest-grossing film of all time in the United States and Canada, surpassing Cameron's "Titanic". "Avatar" also became the first movie to ever earn more than $2 billion worldwide. Including revenue from the re-release of "Avatar" featuring extended footage, it grossed $760.5 million in the U.S. and Canada, and more than $2.78 billion worldwide. It was nominated for nine Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Best Director, and won three for Best Art Direction, Best Cinematography and Best Visual Effects.
Avatar's blockbuster success made Cameron the highest earner in Hollywood for 2010, netting him $257 million as reported by Vanity Fair. 
"Sanctum" (2011).
Most recently, James Cameron served as the executive producer of "Sanctum", a $30,000,000 (estimated budget) film detailing the expedition of a team of underwater cave divers who find themselves trapped in a cave, their exit blocked and no known way to reach the surface either in person or with radio contact. The film is based on co-writer and Cameron's right-hand Andrew Wight death-or-life experience in Nullarbor Plain caves in 1998.
Planned films.
In October 2010, Cameron signed an agreement with Fox to direct two sequels to "Avatar", which are scheduled to be released in December 2015 and December 2016. Another project Cameron has announced is a personal commitment to shoot a film on the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki as told through the story of Tsutomu Yamaguchi, a man who survived both attacks. Cameron met with Yamaguchi just days before he died in 2010.
Awards.
Cameron received the Bradbury Award from the Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America in 1991 for "".
But, being primarily thought of as a genre filmmaker, he did not receive any major mainstream filmmaking awards prior to "Titanic". For "Titanic", Cameron won numerous awards, including: Academy Awards for Best Picture (shared with Jon Landau), Best Director and Best Film Editing (shared with Conrad Buff and Richard A. Harris), and Golden Globes for Best Motion Picture - Drama and Best Director.
In recognition of "a distinguished career as a Canadian filmmaker", Carleton University, Ottawa, awarded Cameron the honorary degree of Doctor of Fine Arts on June 13, 1998. Cameron accepted the degree in person and gave the Convocation Address.
He also received an honorary doctorate in October 1998 from Brock University in St. Catharines, Ontario, for his accomplishments in the international film industry.
In 1998, Cameron attended convocation to receive an honorary doctorate of Laws from Ryerson University, Toronto. The university awards its highest honor to those who have made extraordinary contributions in Canada, or internationally.
In 1999, Cameron received the honorary Doctor of Fine Arts degree from California State University, Fullerton, where he had been a student in the 1970s. He received the degree at the university's annual Commencement exercises that year, where he gave the keynote speech.
In recognition of his contributions to underwater filming and remote vehicle technology, the University of Southampton awarded Cameron the honorary degree of Doctor of the University. Cameron did not attend the Engineering Sciences graduation ceremony in July 2004 where the degree was awarded but instead received it in person at the National Oceanography Centre.
On June 3, 2008, it was announced that he would be inducted into Canada's Walk of Fame. On December 18, 2009, the same day "Avatar" was released worldwide, Cameron received the 2,396th star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. After the release of "Avatar", on February 28, 2010, Cameron was also honored with a Visual Effects Society (VES) Lifetime Achievement Award.
For "Avatar", Cameron won numerous awards as well, including: Golden Globes for Best Motion Picture - Drama (shared with Jon Landau) and Best Director. He was nominated for three Academy Awards: Best Picture, Best Director and Best Film Editing (shared with John Refoua and Stephen E. Rivkin). However, Cameron and "Avatar" lost to his former wife Kathryn Bigelow and her film, "The Hurt Locker".
On September 24, 2010 James Cameron was named Number 1 in The 2010 Guardian Film Power 100 list. In a list compiled by the British magazine New Statesman in September 2010, he was listed 30th in the list of "The World's 50 Most Influential Figures 2010".
Awards.
Cameron has received numerous awards; mainly for "Titanic" and "Avatar".
Collaborations.
Cameron often casts certain actors more than once in his films. Cameron has consistently worked with Bill Paxton, Michael Biehn, Lance Henriksen, Jenette Goldstein and Arnold Schwarzenegger.
1 Although Wisher Jr. has written some of Cameron's works, he is listed in the above table as an actor.2 His reprised role of Reese was cut from the theatrical release, but restored in the DVD's Special Edition Version.
Recurring themes.
Cameron's films have recurring themes and subtexts. These include the conflicts between humanity and technology, the dangers of corporate greed, strong female characters, and a strong romance subplot. In almost all films, the main characters usually get into dramatic crisis situations with significant threats to their own life or even the threat of an impending apocalypse.
While "The Abyss" dealt with deep sea exploration (shot on a studio set), Cameron himself became an expert in the field of deep sea wreckage exploration, exploring the wreckage of Titanic and Bismarck. Cameron will return to this theme with "The Dive", shooting from a minisub.
So important is technology in Cameron's films that he waited years for the technical tools of the craft to advance sufficiently to realize his vision for "Avatar", for which he had special 3-D cameras developed.
Filmography.
Cameron has contributed to many projects as either a writer, director, producer, or as a combination of the three.
Cameron's first film was the 1978 science fiction short film "Xenogenesis", which he directed, wrote and produced. Cameron's films have grossed a total of over $7 billion worldwide.
In addition to works of fiction, Cameron has directed and appeared in several documentaries including "Ghosts of the Abyss" and "Aliens of the Deep". He also contributed to a number of television series including "Dark Angel" and "Entourage". He plans to shoot a small drama film after the Avatar trilogy, just to prove that 3D works even for domestic dramas.
Personal life.
Cameron has been married five times to the following spouses: Sharon Williams (1978–1984), Gale Anne Hurd (1985–1989), director Kathryn Bigelow (1989–1991), Linda Hamilton (1997–1999, daughter Josephine born in 1993), and Suzy Amis (2000-present). Cameron dated Hamilton since 1991, but the two didn't marry until 1997. Eight months after the marriage, however, they separated, and within days of Cameron's Oscar victory with "Titanic," the couple announced their divorce. As part of the divorce settlement, Cameron was ordered to pay Hamilton $50 million. Hamilton later revealed that the reason for their divorce was not only Cameron's blind devotion to his work to the exclusion of almost everything else, but also that he had been having an affair with Suzy Amis, an actress he cast in "Titanic." He married Amis in 2000, and they have one son and two daughters. Cameron lives in Malibu, California, with his wife.
On February 2, 2012, the Associated Press said Cameron would be moving to New Zealand to film "Avatar".
Hurd was the producer of Cameron's "The Terminator", "Aliens", and "The Abyss", and the executive producer of "". Hamilton played the role of Sarah Connor in both "Terminator" films. Amis played the part of Lizzy Calvert, Rose's granddaughter, in "Titanic". Both Cameron ("Avatar") and Bigelow ("The Hurt Locker") were nominated for the Oscar, Golden Globe, and BAFTA Award for Best Director for films released in 2009. Cameron won the Golden Globe, while Bigelow won the Oscar and the BAFTA for Best Director, becoming the first woman to win either. 
Cameron is a member of the NASA Advisory Council and is working on the project to put cameras on an upcoming manned Mars mission. Cameron has also given speeches and raised money for the Mars Society, a non-profit organization lobbying for the colonization of Mars.
Cameron became an expert on deep-sea exploration in conjunction with his research and underwater filming surrounding "The Abyss" (1989) and "Titanic" (1997). In June 2010, Cameron met in Washington with the EPA to discuss possible solutions to the 2010 Deepwater Horizon (BP) oil spill. Later that week at the All Things Digital Conference, he attracted some notoriety when he stated, "Over the last few weeks I've watched...and been thinking, 'Those morons don't know what they're doing'." Reportedly, Cameron had offered BP help to plug the oil well, but they declined. The oil spill was eventually stopped using techniques similar to those Cameron recommended.
Although Cameron has lived his entire adult life in the United States, he remains a Canadian citizen. Cameron applied for American citizenship but withdrew his application after George W. Bush won the presidential election in 2004. 
Cameron calls himself "Converted Agnostic", and says "I've sworn off agnosticism, which I now call cowardly atheism". As a child he described the Lord's Prayer as being a 'tribal chant'.
In 2012, Cameron and his children adopted a vegan diet.
Deep sea dives.
On March 7, 2012, Cameron took the "Deepsea Challenger" submersible to the bottom of the New Britain Trench in a five-mile-deep solo dive. On March 26, 2012, Cameron reached the Challenger Deep, the deepest part of the Mariana Trench. He spent more than three hours exploring the ocean floor before returning to the surface. Cameron is the first person to accomplish the trip solo. He was preceded by unmanned dives in 1995 and 2009, and by Jacques Piccard and Don Walsh, who were the first men to reach the bottom of the Mariana Trench aboard the Bathyscaphe Trieste in 1960. Cameron is making a three-dimensional film of his dive.
Influence.
Cameron's directional style has provided great influence throughout the film industry. "Buffy the Vampire Slayer" and "Firefly" creator Joss Whedon stated that Cameron's approach to action scenes was influential to those in "The Avengers". He also cited Cameron as "the leader and the teacher and the Yoda". Michael Bay considers Cameron an idol and was convinced by him to use 3D in "".
Reputation.
In 1999, Cameron was labeled selfish and cruel by one collaborator, author Orson Scott Card, who had been hired a decade earlier to work with Cameron on the novelization of "The Abyss". Card said the experience was "hell on wheels. He was very nice to me, because I could afford to walk away. But he made everyone around him miserable, and his unkindness did nothing to improve the film in any way. Nor did it motivate people to work faster or better. And unless he changes his way of working with people, I hope he never directs anything of mine. In fact, now that this is in print, I can fairly guarantee that he will never direct anything of mine. Life is too short to collaborate with selfish, cruel people."
After working with Cameron on "Titanic", Kate Winslet decided she would not work with Cameron again unless she earned "a lot of money." She said that Cameron was a nice man, but she found his temper difficult to deal with. In an editorial, the British newspaper "The Independent" said that Cameron "is a nightmare to work with. Studios have come to fear his habit of straying way over schedule and over budget. He is notorious on set for his uncompromising and dictatorial manner, as well as his flaming temper."
Sam Worthington, who worked with Cameron, stated on "The Jay Leno Show" that Cameron had very high expectations from everyone: he would use a nail gun to nail the film crew's cell phones to a wall above an exit door in retaliation for unwanted ringing during production. Other actors, such as Bill Paxton and Sigourney Weaver, have praised Cameron's perfectionism. Weaver said of Cameron: "He really does want us to risk our lives and limbs for the shot, but he doesn't mind risking his own." Michael Biehn has also praised Cameron, claiming "Jim is a really passionate person. He cares more about his movies than other directors care about their movies", but added "I’ve never seen him yell at anybody." However, Biehn did claim Cameron is "not real sensitive when it comes to actors." 
Composer James Horner refused to work with Cameron for a decade following their strained working relationship on 1986's "Aliens"; they eventually settled their differences, and Horner went on to score both "Titanic" and "Avatar".
An episode of "South Park" from its 16th season depicted the director as being self-obsessed. He is seen going deep sea diving while playing his own theme song and appearing oblivious to his overtly bored ship's crew. The episode also credits him for "raising the bar" on entertainment.
During the 70th Golden Globe Awards ceremony, co-host Amy Poehler prompted laughter and audible gasps when she joked about a controversy around the depiction of torture in "Zero Dark Thirty", a film co-produced and directed by Cameron's ex-wife Kathryn Bigelow. According to Poehler, "when it comes to torture, I trust a lady who spent three years married to James Cameron."

"2 Broke Girls" is an American television sitcom created by Michael Patrick King and Whitney Cummings, who also serve as executive producers. It airs on the CBS network. The series stars Kat Dennings as Max, who comes from a poor working-class family, and Beth Behrs as Caroline, who was born rich but is now down on her luck, working together at a Brooklyn restaurant. Each episode ends with a running tally of the money earned out of the $250,000 the girls need to open a cupcake business, whether it increases or decreases. The first season consists of 24 episodes, which aired from September 19, 2011 to May 7, 2012. The series has been renewed for a second season. All episodes start with the word "And" with the obvious exception of "Pilot", so the titles read, "2 Broke Girls and the Break-up Scene", for example.

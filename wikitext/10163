Overview.
Emily Thorne (Emily VanCamp) comes to the Hamptons, renting a home next to the Grayson family to enjoy the summer. However, it is revealed that Emily has been to the Hamptons before as a little girl. In reality, Emily is Amanda Clarke, whose father was framed for a crime he did not commit and sent to prison for life. She was permanently separated from him and never saw him again. Now, she has returned to the Hamptons, intent on getting revenge on those who wronged her and her father. At the top of her list is Victoria Grayson (Madeleine Stowe), matriarch of the Grayson family and the woman whom her father loved and who, in the end, betrayed him. Emily wants to get revenge on them all. 
As she sets her plan in motion, Emily tries to navigate the upper society to destroy those who betrayed her father. But the further she goes, the more her emotions get involved and the more she questions her motives and the moves she makes.

Dorothy Rabinowitz of "The Wall Street Journal" praised the series, writing that "The arrival of one pure and unadulterated drama about a passion as old as man is something to celebrate. That's particularly true when that drama is as spellbinding in its satisfyingly gaudy way, as "Revenge" turns out to be", whilst awarding particular praise to Van Camp for a "beguiling and entirely chilling study in revenge lust." Writing for "The New York Times", Alessandra Stanley compared the series favorably with "Gossip Girl", concluding that it has "just enough campy suspense to be enjoyable."

Orlando of "TV Fanatic" writing that "Revenge took things to a whole new level this week", and noting with reference to the set-up of David Clarke that "Victoria seems the only one with a conscience".

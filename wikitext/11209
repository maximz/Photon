Felicity Ann Kendal, CBE (born 25 September 1946) is an English actress known for her television and stage work. Kendal has appeared in numerous stage and screen roles over a 45-year career, and the role that brought attention to her career is Barbara Good in the 1975 television series "The Good Life".
Early life.
Felicity Kendal was born in Warwickshire, England, in 1946. She is the younger daughter of Geoffrey Kendal, an actor and manager, and his wife Laura (née Lidell). Her sister, Jennifer Kendal (died 1984, aged 49), also became an actress.
Kendal spent much of her childhood in India as her father was an English actor-manager who made his living leading a repertory company on tours of India. The family would perform Shakespeare before royalty one day, and in rough rural villages the next where audiences included many schoolchildren. Her father had adopted his birthplace of Kendal, (then Westmorland now Cumbria), as his stage name, his original surname being Bragg. Felicity Kendal was educated at six convents in India. At age 17, Kendal contracted typhoid in Calcutta. She left India at the age of 20.
The Good Life.
In 1975 Kendal received (what turned out to be) her break on television with the BBC sitcom "The Good Life". Kendal starred with Richard Briers in playing Tom and Barbara Good – a middle-class suburban couple who decide to quit the rat race and become self-sufficient, much to the consternation of their snooty, but well-meaning neighbours (played by Penelope Keith and Paul Eddington). Kendal appeared in all 30 episodes which extended over four seasons from 1975 to 1978.
Kendal has stated that she can be "short-tempered and difficult" – which is in contrast to the character of Barbara – with whom the public have come to associate her.
Stage work.
Kendal made her stage debut aged nine months, when she was carried on stage as a changeling boy in "A Midsummer Night's Dream".
She made her London stage debut in "Minor Murder" (1967), and went on to star in a number of well regarded plays.
Kendal's stage career blossomed during the 1980s and 1990s when she formed a close professional association with Sir Tom Stoppard, starring in the first productions of many of his plays, including "The Real Thing" (1982), "Hapgood" (1988), "Arcadia" (1993), and "Indian Ink" (1995). This last was originally a radio play and the role was written for her.
She won the Evening Standard Theatre Award in 1989 for her performances in "Much Ado About Nothing" and "Ivanov".
In 2002, Kendal starred in Charlotte Jones's play, "Humble Boy", when it transferred from the National Theatre to the West End. In 2006 she starred in the West End revival of "Amy's View" by David Hare.
In 2008 she appeared in the West End in a revival of Noël Coward's play "The Vortex".
In 2009 she appeared in the play "The Last Cigarette" (by Simon Gray) and in 2010 in "Mrs Warren's Profession" (by Shaw). Both played at the Chichester Festival Theatre and subsequently in the West End.
In 2013 she will star in the first London revival of "Relatively Speaking" by Alan Ayckbourn.
Awards.
Kendal was made a CBE in 1995 for services to drama.
In 1995 (at age 49) Kendal was selected as one of the "100 sexiest women in the world" by FHM magazine.
Personal life.
Kendal's first marriage to Drewe Henley (1968 to 1979) and her second to Michael Rudman (1983 to 1990) ended in divorce. Kendal has two sons: Charley, from her marriage to Henley, and Jacob, from her marriage to Rudman. In 1991 she left Rudman, and subsequently started a relationship with playwright Tom Stoppard. The affair with Stoppard ended in 1998, and Kendal has since reunited with Michael Rudman.
Kendal was raised by Catholic parents. She converted to Judaism at the time of her second marriage, and has stated about the conversion, "I felt I was returning to my roots".
In 1998 Kendal published a book of memoirs titled "White Cargo".
When asked (by The Guardian in 2010) who she would invite to her "dream dinner party", Kendal replied "Emmeline Pankhurst, Gandhi, Byron, Eddie Izzard, George Bernard Shaw, Golda Meir, Marlene Dietrich".

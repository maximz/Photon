"8 Simple Rules".
In 2002 Cuoco, at the age of 16, began a starring role as Bridget Hennessy on the ABC sitcom "8 Simple Rules". Bridget was the eldest child, despite Cuoco being six years younger than her on-screen little sister (Amy Davidson), and was portrayed as "the most beautiful girl in the school." She had several boyfriends throughout the series and used her feminine wiles to exert significant control over the boys she encountered. After co-star John Ritter's death, the show returned on November 4, 2003, with a one-hour episode, "Goodbye", which was dedicated to Ritter's death. Subsequent episodes dealt with the family's reaction to his death and them moving on from it. ABC cancelled the series on May 17, 2005 after three seasons due to low ratings.

"Charmed".
In the eighth season of the hit cult TV show "Charmed", Cuoco appeared as Billie Jenkins, a powerful young witch who was also one of whitelighter Paige Matthews' charges. Billie has the power of telekinesis, the ability to move objects with her mind. While the sisters assume new identities during the first few episodes of the season, she keeps their secret and does some of their magical legwork for them. Billie spent most of the season trying to find her eldest sister Christy Jenkins, who had been kidnapped 15 years ago by The Triad. Billie is eventually reunited with her sister, but does not know that she had been turned evil under the influence of demons. After Christy briefly sways her to betray The Charmed Ones, Billie eventually sides with them in the series finale and is forced to kill her sister in self-defense. Executive producer Brad Kern stated Kaley's character was initially brought in as a possible spin-off.

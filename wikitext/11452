Roy Frank “RJ” Mitte III (born August 21, 1992) is an American actor best known for his role as Walter White, Jr. or “Flynn” on the AMC television series, "Breaking Bad".
Like his character on "Breaking Bad", Mitte has mild cerebral palsy. With cerebral palsy (CP), the brain is damaged in infancy, often as a result of cerebral anoxia. As a result, his motor skills and ability to control his muscles were affected. For instance, his arm uncontrollably jumps. 
When he moved to Hollywood in 2006, he began training with personal talent manager Addison Witt, who also has a form of the condition. Mitte and Witt sought out acting opportunities where his disability would serve to educate viewers, which led him to audition for the role in "Breaking Bad".

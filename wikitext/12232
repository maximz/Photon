Andrew Michael "Andy" Milonakis (born January 30, 1976) is an American actor, writer, rapper, and comedian of Greek descent best known for creating and starring in "The Andy Milonakis Show" on MTV and MTV2. In 2013, he began a recurring role on the Comedy Central sketch series "Kroll Show" playing the role of Roman Armond.
Early life.
Milonakis was born with a congenital growth-hormone condition that gives him the outward appearance and voice of an adolescent even though he is an adult. In his high school years at John Jay High School, in Cross River, New York, he would use comedy as a means to cope with incessant bullying. "Humor is a great defense mechanism," says Milonakis. "If you're a serious, fat, young-looking kid, you're not going to be the most popular guy in high school."

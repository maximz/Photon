Workaholics is a television sitcom that premiered on Comedy Central on April 5, 2011. The series is in its third season, and is predominantly written by its stars Blake Anderson, Adam DeVine, Anders Holm, and co-creator Kyle Newacheck who play, respectively, three recent college dropouts, roommates, and co-workers at a telemarketing company -- and their drug dealer, in Rancho Cucamonga, California.
Synopsis.
The three main characters (Blake, Adam, and Anders) were roommates in college, and, in a phase-of-life transition, continue to do things associated with college after dropping out (drinking, partying, pranks, etc) as they transition into adulthood. The "friendship family's" action is generally confined to the main characters' house and their workspace, a cubicle the three of them share at a telemarketing company called TelAmeriCorp. 
Production.
The show was co-created and is largely written by its three stars, Blake Anderson, Adam DeVine, Anders Holm. Frequent co-star Kyle Newacheck also directs most episodes, as well as being a fourth co-creator and serving as executive producer. Kevin Etten is the series' showrunner.
"Workaholics" was ordered by Comedy Central in March 2010 after a Comedy Central executive saw a series of videos the group had posted on YouTube. The pilot aired as a "TV Sneak Peek" after the March 15, 2011, debut of the "Comedy Central Roast of Donald Trump". The program ran its 10-episode first season from April 6, 2011, to June 8, 2011, and aired at 10:30 p.m. EDT on Comedy Central. On May 4, 2011, the show was renewed for a second season of ten episodes, which ran from September 20, 2011, to November 22, 2011. On October 25, 2011, the series was renewed for a third season which contained 20 episodes. The first 10 episodes of season 3 ran from May 29 to July 31, 2012 and the remaining 10 episodes began airing January 16, 2013. Due to the popularity of the series, on January 6, 2013, Comedy Central ordered 13-episode fourth and fifth seasons.

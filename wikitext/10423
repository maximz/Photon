This is a list of countries by population.
Methodology.
The list includes independent countries and inhabited dependent territories based on the ISO standard ISO 3166-1. Partially recognized countries not listed by ISO 3166-1 are included, but not numbered. Also given in percent is each country's population compared to the population of the world, which according to the United States Census Bureau population clock is estimated at  billion.
According to a separate estimate by the United Nations, world population exceeded 7 billion in October 2011. Areas that form integral parts of sovereign states, such as the countries of the United Kingdom, are counted as part of the sovereign states concerned. Not included are other entities, such as the European Union, that are not sovereign states, and dependent territories that do not have permanent populations, such as various countries' claims to Antarctica.
Figures used in this chart are based on the most recent estimate or projections by the national census authority where available, and are usually rounded off. Where updated national data are not available, figures are based on the 2012 estimates by the Population Division of the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs. Because the compiled figures are not collected at the same time in every country, or at the same level of accuracy, the resulting numerical comparisons may engender misleading conclusions. Furthermore, the addition of figures from all countries may not equal the world total.

The following list of cat breeds includes domestic cat breeds and domestic/wild hybrids. The list includes established breeds recognized by various cat registries, new and experimental breeds, distinct domestic population not being actively developed and lapsed breeds.
Inconsistency in breed classification among registries means that an individual animal may be considered different breeds by different registries. For example, The International Cat Association's Himalayan is considered a colorpoint version of the Persian by the Cat Fanciers' Association while the CFA's Javanese is considered a color variation of the Balinese by TICA.
The domestic shorthair and domestic longhair are not breeds but terms used in cat fancy to describe cats that do not belong to a particular breed.

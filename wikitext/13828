AKB48 (read "A.K.B. Forty-eight") is a Japanese girl group. It has achieved such popularity in Japan that it has been characterized as a social phenomenon. The group has 88 members, ranging in age from 13 to mid-20s. Produced by Yasushi Akimoto, it is one of the highest-earning musical acts in the world, with 2011 record sales of over US$200 million in Japan alone. 
As of January 2013, the group's sixteen latest singles topped the Oricon Weekly Singles Chart. In 2010, "Beginner" and "Heavy Rotation" placed, respectively, first and second in the list of Japan's best selling singles for the year. In 2011 and 2012 AKB48's singles occupied the top five spots of the Oricon Yearly Singles Chart. The band has sold over 20 million CDs, and holds the record for most singles sold in Japan by a female group. 
AKB48 is named after Akihabara ("Akiba" for short), the area in Tokyo where the group's own theater is located. The idea of AKB48's producer Yasushi Akimoto was to create a girl group that, unlike a regular pop group, which gives occasional concerts and that is mostly seen on TV, would have its own theater and perform there on a daily basis; the fans would always be able to go and see the girls live. Presently, AKB48 still performs at the theater every day, although, due to great demand, tickets are now distributed only via a lottery.
Personnel.
AKB48 holds the Guinness World Record for being the world's "largest pop group". The group currently consists of a total of 88 girls. The members are divided into three subgroups: Team A and Team K with 21 members each and Team B with 22 members. The group also includes a number of aspiring members, who are called "kenkyūsei" ("trainees"). The member lineup often changes; when girls get older, they "graduate" from the group, while new members are cast through regularly held auditions. Having several teams not only allows the group to reduce the load on its members, since a daily concert at the theater is given by only one team, but also gives AKB48 opportunity to perform in several places and even countries simultaneously.
Yasushi Akimoto is also expanding his theater-based idol group concept to other cities and, since recently, countries. He has formed SKE48 (based at a theater in the Sakae area of Nagoya), SDN48 (intended to have a more mature image), NMB48 (Namba, Osaka), HKT48 (Hakata, Fukuoka), JKT48 (Jakarta, Indonesia), TPE48 (Taipei, Taiwan), SNH48 (Shanghai, China). Another of his recent creations, Nogizaka46, was announced as an official rival for AKB48.
Given the large number of members in the group, who couldn't appear on stage at the same time, AKB48 needed some sort of selection method to determine who will record a single and perform it on TV, for example. So far, two big selection events are held annually. One member lineup is determined by fans who vote for their favorite members in so-called "general elections" ("sōsenkyo" in Japanese) by purchasing the group's latest single that includes a ticket that allows the buyer to register a vote for a particular member. The other is decided in a rock-paper-scissors tournament between the members themselves. The popularity of AKB48 had been so huge that in the 2011 election the number of votes cast exceeded 1 million, and the single "Everyday, Katyusha", that contained a voting ticket for the election, set a new Japanese all-time record for weekly sales of a CD single.
Concept.
AKB48 members are girls whose age ranges from 13 to 20-plus. They are recruited through auditions that are held regularly in Japan. Members of the group are not allowed to have boyfriends, and must be "well-behaved." If they "misbehave", they may be expelled from the group. When members get older, they "graduate" from the group and are replaced by new members.
AKB48 was founded based on the "idols you can meet" concept. The group's producer Yasushi Akimoto decided to create an idol group that, unlike a regular idol group that gives occasional concerts and that is mostly seen on TV, would have its own theater and perform there on a daily basis; the fans would always be able to go and see the girls live. Presently, AKB48 still performs at the theater every day, although, due to great demand, tickets are now distributed only via a lottery. The AKB48 Theater is located in the Don Quijote store in Akihabara, Tokyo.
The group consists of four subgroups: Team A, Team K, Team B, and Team 4. Having several teams not only allows the group to reduce the load on its members, since a daily concert at the theater is given by only one team, but also gives AKB48 opportunity to perform in several places and even countries simultaneously. Each of the teams also has its own unique image. According to member Misaki Iwasa, Team A represents freedom, Team B is very idol-like with cutesy costumes, while Team K has a strong and powerful image. There is also a number of aspiring members (so-called trainees or "Kenkyūsei"), who learn the group's songs and are appointed as stand-ins for the main members, so that a replacement is always available. In addition to singing performances, members are heavily promoted throughout the Japanese mass media. The group regularly holds "handshake events", where fans get a chance to shake hands with the group's members.
In 2009, the concept of "senbatsu general elections" was introduced. In these elections, fans vote for their favourite members of AKB48 and its sister groups. Members who receive most votes get to participate in the recording of AKB48's next single, are more heavily promoted, and get to sing center stage during the group's performances. To obtain a ballot, voters have to buy the group's singles. Another new concept, AKB48's rock-paper-scissors tournaments, was introduced in 2010 for the group's 19th single "Chance no Junban". Members of AKB48 and its sister groups compete against each other in the knockout tournament for being on AKB48's next single.
History.

The 2012 anime series "AKB0048" is also inspired by the group, and is produced by AKB48 producer Yasushi Akimoto. Nine of the characters in this anime are voiced by members of AKB48 and its sister groups. The anime began airing in Japan on April 29, 2012.
Controversies.
Over the years, AKB48 has received criticism for the sexually suggestive texts of many of their songs, which some felt were unsuitable for AKB48's young members. When asked about it by CNN's Anna Coren, Yasushi Akimoto, who is the author of all the AKB48's song lyrics, rebutted that his works were a way of "depicting reality" and were meant to provoke in listeners thought about difficult issues.
The band's risqué music videos also have been a focal point for controversy. Underwear shots, teenage members hugging, kissing, and taking a bath together were complained about. The director of the music video Mika Ninagawa explained she wanted to appeal to both men and women by creating a creative and fun video, due to the group's rising popularity among girls.
A TV commercial for the candy brand Puccho, airing from March 15, 2012, featured several members of AKB48 in schoolgirl uniforms passing a candy from mouth to mouth. Although the girls held the candy between their teeth some viewers were offended, calling it "encouraging homosexuality", apart from being simply "unhygienic" and giving a "bad example to children".
Philanthropy.
A few days after the March 11, 2011 earthquake and tsunami, it was announced that AKB48, its sisters groups and producer Yasushi Akimoto would donate 500 million yen to a 2011 earthquake and tsunami relief fund. A part of the revenue from AKB48's forthcoming album also would go to the relief. The group also asked fans to donate money to a special account.
On March 25, AKB48's official blog reported that that a sum of more than 617 million yen had been donated to the Japanese Red Cross Society.
On April 1, the group issued a digital charity single titled "Dareka no Tame ni (What Can I Do for Someone?)", all profit from which was donated to a 2011 earthquake and tsunami relief fund.
AKB48's 23rd single "Kaze wa Fuiteiru" was also dedicated to the 2011 tsunami victims, its title song's lyrics having been written with the intention of cheering up the Japanese people who were affected by the March 11 disaster.
In February 2012, the group announced another donation to the Japanese Red Cross, of over 580 million yen. It was reported that to date AKB48 had raised a total of over 1.25 billion yen for the earthquake and tsunami relief.

Sister groups.
AKB48 producer Yasushi Akimoto has also created AKB48 sister groups that are based on the same "idols you can meet" concept. Each such sister group has a home theater based in Japan or elsewhere in Asia and releases its own individual singles. Members of the AKB48 sister groups also occasionally feature in AKB48's performances and singles. Jurina Matsui and Miyuki Watanabe, members of AKB48 sister groups, have also been temporary members of AKB48, as well.
AKB48's first sister group, SKE48, was formed in 2008, and their theater is based in Sakae, Nagoya. Subsequently, SDN48 ("Saturday Night"), NMB48, ("Namba"), and HKT48 ("Hakata") were formed. In 2011, the first sister group outside of Japan, JKT48, was announced. The group is based in Jakarta, Indonesia. JKT48 was followed by two more overseas AKB48 sister groups: TPE48, based in Taipei, Taiwan; and SNH48 based in Shanghai, China.
Apart from sister groups, AKB48 also has an "official rival" named Nogizaka46. Created in 2011, Nogizaka46 is named after the Sony Music Japan main office building.

"Two and a Half Men" is a CBS sitcom that premiered on September 22, 2003. Almost every episode's title is a phrase said by one of the characters in that episode. The three exceptions are the pilot episode and the episodes "Alan Harper, Frontier Chiropractor" (Season 1) and "Frankenstein and the Horny Villagers" (Season 2). The latter episode does fit the criterion, but the quote was part of a deleted scene which Chuck Lorre explains in the episode's vanity card.
The episodes "Chocolate Diddlers or My Puppy's Dead" (Season 8) and "Who's Vod Kanockers?" (Season 4) are also not direct quotes; Charlie sings his song called "Chocolate Diddlers", while Alan suggests it sounds more like "My Puppy's Dead". The episode title is offering up a suggestion to which of the two titles the song could be called.
, 218 original episodes have aired.

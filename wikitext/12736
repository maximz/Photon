Usage.
In English and most other European languages, "P" is a voiceless bilabial plosive. Both initial and final 'p's can be combined with many other discrete consonants in English words. A common example of assimilation is the tendency of prefixes ending in 'n" to assume an 'm' sound before 'p's (such as: 'in' + 'pulse' → 'impulse' — see: List of Latin words with English derivatives).
A common digraph in English is 'ph', which represents the voiceless labiodental fricative , and can be used to transliterate Phi ('φ') in loanwords from Greek. In German, the digraph 'pf' is common, representing a labial affricate of .

Most English words beginning with P are of foreign origin, primarily French, Latin, Greek, and Slavic; these languages preserve Proto-Indo-European initial /*p/. English cognates of such words often start with F, since English is a Germanic language and thus has undergone Grimm's law; a native English word with initial /p/ would reflect Proto-Indo-European initial /*b/, which is so rare that its existence as a phoneme is disputed.

1994-2008: Early life and career beginnings.
Englert was born in 1994 in Sydney, Australia. She is the daughter of New Zealand-born, Australian-based director Jane Campion, and Australian filmmaker Colin David Englert. She was raised in Sydney and on locations where her mother's work took the family, explaining, “I’ve spent half my life on planes. I have a lot of love for New Zealand, though. That is where the really arty, whimsical side of the family resided — in hobbitland.” She attended schools in New York City, London, New Zealand, Rome and Australia, one of them being Sibford School, a boarding school in Oxfordshire, England. Her parents divorced when she was 7, and she made her film debut at 8 in "Listen", followed, at 12, by her mother's short film "The Water Diary". She left high school to become an actress.
2010-present.

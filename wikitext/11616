Rules of Engagement is a sitcom that debuted on CBS on February 5, 2007 as a midseason replacement. 
The series is produced by Adam Sandler's Happy Madison Productions in association with CBS Television Studios and Sony Pictures Television (SPT controls North American rights; CBS controls international rights).
On May 21, 2012, CBS renewed "Rules of Engagement" for a seventh season of 13 episodes to air midseason, bringing the total number of produced episodes to 100. Season 7 began airing on Mondays at 8:30, starting February 4, 2013.
Premise.
Two couples and their single friend deal with the complications of dating, commitment and marriage. It looks at different relationships in various stages, starring Patrick Warburton and Megyn Price as a long-married couple, Oliver Hudson and Bianca Kajlich as newly engaged sweethearts, and David Spade and Adhir Kalyan (the latter added in season 3) as their still-single friends. They often gather to enjoy a meal at "The Island Diner". The show features writers from the Emmy Award–winning "Everybody Loves Raymond".
History.
The show was heavily promoted by CBS during Super Bowl XLI and launched the following night, the first of seven episodes in its first season. The pilot episode remains the highest rated episode of the show. The series was renewed for a second season which began as a midseason replacement for "The New Adventures of Old Christine" on Monday, September 24, 2007, with production halted after nine episodes on November 6, 2007, in the wake of a writers' strike. After the strike ended, CBS announced that the show would return April 14, 2008, with a further six episodes. 
Seasons three and four were both mid-season entries launched in March 2009 and March 2010. On May 18, 2010, it was announced that CBS had renewed "Rules of Engagement" for a 5th season. It was later announced that this season would start in September, in contrast to its usual midseason start, and received an expanded 24-episode order. (The fifth season was the first and only season to have a full-season order.) The first 15 episodes aired on Monday nights, usually in the 8:30 pm Eastern/7:30 pm Central time slot following "How I Met Your Mother". Then on February 24, 2011, the series moved to Thursdays at 8:30 pm Eastern/7:30 pm Central, following "The Big Bang Theory", after the cancellation of "$h*! My Dad Says". 
On May 17, 2011, the series was renewed for a sixth season to begin airing in fall 2011. One day later, CBS announced that "Rules of Engagement" would move to Saturday nights at 8:00 pm Eastern/7:00 pm Central as part of the network's new "Comedytime Saturday" block; the first time in six years that an original CBS program would air on that night. It also marked the fourth night that the series would air on, with it previously airing on Mondays, Wednesdays (two airings), and Thursdays. On October 7, 2011, however, it was announced that "Rules of Engagement" would move back to its 8:30PM EST Thursday timeslot following "The Big Bang Theory", replacing new sitcom "How to Be a Gentleman" which was moved to the new Saturday time slot.
Effective January 12, 2012, CBS removed "Rules of Engagement" from its Thursday lineup, replacing it with the new sitcom "Rob" starring Rob Schneider. CBS later announced that "Rules" would return to its Thursday 8:30 PM time slot on March 29, after "Rob" had finished airing its 8-episode order, resulting in a total of 15 season 6 episodes.
The series was officially renewed for a seventh season of 13 episodes on May 21, 2012. It returned on February 4, 2013 airing in the Monday night 8:30 pm Eastern/7:30 pm Central timeslot, where it aired for one and a half seasons.
Syndication.
In June 2011, the series was picked up for syndication by both CW affiliates and WGN America, making its debut on September 10, 2012.
On Wednesday, January 2, 2013, the series began airing weekdays on TBS at 2/1c, but moved to 11/10c beginning on Monday, January 28, 2013.
DVD releases.
Sony Pictures Home Entertainment owns the rights to release DVDs in Region 1 – so far, the first five seasons are available. The fifth season of the series was made available beginning February 7, 2012, exclusively as a made-on-demand release from Sony Pictures Home Entertainment, in conjunction with amazon.com. Similarly, the sixth season received a MOD release from online retailers, on October 2, 2012.
Paramount Pictures, in conjunction with CBS Home Entertainment, will start releasing the series on DVD internationally in 2011. Season One was released in the UK (Region 2 DVD) on April 4, 2011.
Note: Following the events of Charlie Sheen’s departure from "Two and a Half Men", CBS ordered an additional two episodes for "Rules of Engagement"’s fifth season, bringing the total number of episodes to 26 from the initial 24 ordered. Despite the episodes, “Scavenger Hunt” and “Cheating,” airing during the sixth season, they were originally produced for the fifth season, and are included in the fifth season collection. Therefore, the sixth season’s DVD release features the 13 episodes produced over that time period, versus the 15 that were broadcast by CBS.
International broadcasters.
Polish version.
Polish channel TVN started filming its own version of the show, called "Reguły Gry" (literally meaning "Rules of the Game" in Polish). It premiered on 16 February 2012 on TVN sister channel TVN 7 as its first original production.

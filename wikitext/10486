Once Upon a Time is an American fairy tale drama television series created by Edward Kitsis and Adam Horowitz, who also serve as executive producers alongside Steve Pearlman. It debuted on ABC on October 23, 2011. The series revolves around a bail bond agent, Emma (Jennifer Morrison) and her birth-son, Henry (Jared S. Gilmore) who are about to discover that a New England town, aptly titled Storybrooke, Maine, is actually a remnant of a parallel world that was cursed by The Evil Queen/Regina Mills (Lana Parrilla) from the fairy tale "Snow White" and that all the characters from the fairy tales have no memories of who they were, including the parents of the bail bond agent, Snow White/Mary Margaret Blanchard (Ginnifer Goodwin) and Prince Charming/David Nolan (Josh Dallas), who sent her away so she can save their world and break the curse.

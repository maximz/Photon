In its early years, they were referred to as Disney Channel Premiere Films, and later Premears. From late 1997 onwards, such productions have been branded under the Disney Channel Original Movies (DCOM) banner.
Most hit films were subsequently released on VHS, DVD, or, more recently, Blu-ray. However, many more in the DCOM library have never been released in any home video format.

Also, although DCOMs have been produced in widescreen HD format since mid-2005, the 2009 release of "Princess Protection Program" became the first DCOM to receive a widescreen DVD transfer.
The highest-rated premiere for the brand came in August 2007, when "High School Musical 2" set a record for basic cable with 17.2 million viewers. The second highest-rated premiere is held by ', which premiered with 11.4 million viewers.

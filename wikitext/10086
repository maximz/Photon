"How I Met Your Mother" is an American situation comedy (sitcom) that premiered on CBS on September 19, 2005. The show was created by Craig Thomas and Carter Bays. "How I Met Your Mother" is framed by the year 2030, when Ted Mosby (voiced by Bob Saget) gathers his daughter (Lyndsy Fonseca) and son (David Henrie) to tell them the story of how he met their mother. We flashback to where it begins in 2005 with Ted Mosby (Josh Radnor) as a single, 27-year-old architect living with his two best friends from Wesleyan University, Marshall Eriksen (Jason Segel), a law student, and Lily Aldrin (Alyson Hannigan), a kindergarten teacher, who have been dating for almost nine years when Marshall proposes. Their engagement causes Ted to think about finding his own soul mate, much to the disgust of his friend Barney Stinson (Neil Patrick Harris), a womanizer with an unnamed corporate job. And thus, Ted begins his search for his perfect mate, and meets Robin Scherbatsky (Cobie Smulders), whom he also befriends. The 100th episode of "How I Met Your Mother" aired on January 11, 2010. On December 21, 2012, the series was renewed for a ninth season.
On January 30, 2013, it was announced that Season 9 will be its final season.

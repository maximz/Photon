The Incoterms rules or International Commercial terms are a series of pre-defined commercial terms published by the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) that are widely used in International commercial transactions. A series of three-letter trade terms related to common contractual sales practices, the Incoterms rules are intended primarily to clearly communicate the tasks, costs, and risks associated with the transportation and delivery of goods. 
The Incoterms rules are accepted by governments, legal authorities, and practitioners worldwide for the interpretation of most commonly used terms in international trade. They are intended to reduce or remove altogether uncertainties arising from different interpretation of the rules in different countries. As such they are regularly incorporated into sales contracts worldwide. 
First published in 1936, the Incoterms rules have been periodically updated, with the eighth version—"Incoterms 2010"—having been published on January 1, 2011. "Incoterms" is a registered trademark of the ICC.
History.
The Incoterms rules genesis can be traced to 1921, with the formation of the idea by the International Chamber of Commerce. 
In 1936, the first set of the Incoterms rules was published. The first set remained in use for almost 20 years, before the second publication in 1953. Additional amendments and expansions followed in 1967, 1976, 1980, 1990, and 2000. 
The 8th and current version of the Incoterms rules—Incoterms 2010—was published on January 1, 2011.
"Incoterms 2010".
The eighth published set of pre-defined terms, "Incoterms 2010" defines 11 rules, reducing the 13 used in Incoterms 2000 by introducing two new rules ("Delivered at Terminal", DAT; "Delivered at Place", DAP) that replace four rules of the prior version ("Delivered at Frontier", DAF; "Delivered Ex Ship", DES; "Delivered Ex Quay", DEQ; "Delivered Duty Unpaid", DDU). In the prior version, the rules were divided into four categories, but the 11 pre-defined terms of "Incoterms 2010" are subdivided into two categories based only on method of delivery. The larger group of seven rules applies regardless of the method of transport, with the smaller group of four being applicable only to sales that solely involve transportation over water.
Any mode of transport.
The 7 rules defined by "Incoterms 2010" for any mode(s) of transportation are:-

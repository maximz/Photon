Life and career.
Marlohe was born in Paris, France. Her father, a doctor, is of Chinese and Cambodian descent, while her mother, a teacher, is French. She originally held aspirations of becoming a pianist, as well as an artist, studying at the prestigious French arts school Conservatoire de Paris for ten years.
She is known to be a strong believer in fate. During an interview, she stated that she dreamt of acting alongside Javier Bardem six months before her "Bond" audition. After the dream, she knew that everything would be fine. It was not until the second audition for "Skyfall" that someone mentioned to her that Bardem might also be cast.

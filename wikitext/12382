In the documentary movie "The Big Question", about the film "The Passion of the Christ", she stated: "I am an agnostic, even though I respect and am interested in all religions. If there's something I believe in, it's a mysterious energy; the one that fills the oceans during tides, the one that unites nature and beings."
In September 2012 at a Toronto International Film Festival press conference for the Iranian movie "Rhino Season", Monica stated that she can speak four languages: Italian, French, English and (some) Persian.

Antonio Joseph "Tony" Mendez (born 1940) is an American CIA technical operations officer, now retired, who specialized in support of clandestine and covert CIA operations. He has written three memoirs about his CIA experiences.
Mendez was decorated, and is now widely known, for his on-the-scene management of the "Canadian caper" during the Iran hostage crisis, in which he exfiltrated six American diplomats from Iran in November 1979. Posing as a Canadian film crew, they were accompanied by Dennis Packer, a CBC cameraman. As part of their cover, the diplomats carried passports issued by the Canadian government to document them as Canadian citizens. 
After declassification of records, the full details of the operation were reported in a 2007 article by Joshuah Bearman in "Wired" magazine. This was loosely adapted for the screenplay and development of the 2012 American film "Argo", directed by Ben Affleck, who also starred as Mendez. Mendez also attended the Golden Globes to give a speech, where the film was nominated (and later won) for Best Dramatic Motion Picture.<ref>

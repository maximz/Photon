Background.
Marcus was born on January 31, 1987, in Anaheim, California, to British parents. As a result, he has held both British and American citizenship from birth.
Mumford's family moved back to their native England when Marcus was six months old. He grew up on Chatsworth Avenue in Wimbledon Chase, south-west London, and attended King's College School in Wimbledon. Here he met future fellow band member Ben Lovett.

It was in Edinburgh that he penned most of Mumford & Sons' debut album, "Sigh No More". He began his musical career playing drums for Laura Marling on tour, along with the other current members of Mumford & Sons. It was through touring with Marling and gaining experience playing important gigs, as well as experimenting with his early writing that they decided to set up the band in 2007.

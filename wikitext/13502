This is a list of the most populous cities in the world defined according to a concept of city proper (an urban locality without its suburbs). A city proper is a locality defined according to legal or political boundaries and an administratively recognized urban status that is usually characterized by some form of local government. 
"World Urbanization Prospects", a United Nations publication, defines the population of a city proper as "the population living within the administrative boundaries of a city." The book continues to say that "city proper as defined by administrative boundaries may not include suburban areas where an important proportion of the population working or studying in the city lives."
The term city can take on many meanings in different parts of the world. For the purposes of this list, the definition of a city as a primarily urban locality is used. This list enumerates the populations of some of the world's largest cities, the boundaries of which may or may not correspond to those of municipalities. The populations listed are for the administratively defined city and not for the urban area nor the metropolitan area. Statistical definitions for each city, approximate surface area, and population density are also indicated.

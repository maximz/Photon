History.
The first recorded European to sight Anuanuraro Atoll was British naval officer and explorer Philip Carteret in 1767. He named this atoll "Archangel". 
Formerly Ananuararo Atoll belonged to Robert Wan, the wealthy Tahitian pearl trader. It was bought back by the government of French Polynesia in March 2002.
This atoll has an airfield which was built by Wan's company, Wan-Polynésie. It was opened in 1982 but is now in disuse.

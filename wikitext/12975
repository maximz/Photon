Plot.
Jagdish (Vijay), a captain in the Indian Army, returns to Mumbai from Kashmir. On his arrival, he is forced by his parents and younger sisters into seeing Nisha (Kajal Aggarwal), a girl of their choice for their son to get married to. At the bride-viewing ceremony, Jagdish makes up excuses to avoid marrying her, such as commenting that she is old-fashioned. On the contrary, Nisha turns out to be a college-level boxer who is completely modern in outlook. Jagdish realises this and falls for her, which she reciprocates.
One day, while hanging out with his police officer-friend Balaji (Sathyan), Jagdish witnesses the explosion of a bus in which they had travelled. He captures the man who planted the bomb in that bus and soon finds out that he is a mere pawn (a sleeper cell) whose only role was in planting the bomb and that the terrorist group he belongs to have planned various such attacks in the city in a couple of days. Enlisting the help of his fellow Army men and Balaji, Jagdish manages to thwart these attacks. 
When the leader of the terrorist group (Vidyut Jamwal) finds out about the role of Jagdish in the failure of the terrorist attack, he begins to target the families of the Army men (except Jagdish), kidnapping someone close to them. When Jagdish finds out, he substitutes one of the people to be kidnapped with his younger sister. Using his pet dog and his sister's dupatta, he manages to reach the terrorists' hideout, rescuing his sister (who was about to be killed after Jagdish's bluff was exposed) and the others and killing the terrorists.
With this attack too failed, the terrorist leader decides to target Jagdish himself. He asks Jagdish to surrender to him, failing which there would be more terrorist attacks. Jagdish decides to sacrifice his life and hatches a plan with his fellow Army men. Jagdish meets the leader in a ship, which has been rigged with a bomb planted by Jagdish's henchman. When he finds out about the leader's plan however (which is to expose Jagdish's Army team as terrorists), he fights the leader and escapes with him in a boat. After the ship explodes, he kills the leader.
The movie ends with Jagdish and his team returning to Kashmir.

Critical reception.
"Thuppakki" received mostly positive reviews from critics. L Romal M Singh of DNA India stated that the film "is different. The difference is visible in every shot, every dialogue spoken and the amazing attention to detail. What stands out most in this incredibly entertaining film is that Tamil films have finally come of age â€” in so many interesting ways". Behindwoods.com rated the film 3.5 out of 5 stars, calling it "a fully loaded festival package from Vijay, Murugadoss and co". "Deccan Chronicle" rated it 3.5/5 and cited: ""Thuppaki" has come out as an action thriller that depends on mind games and smart plans rather than bloody fights. This is Murugadosâ€™s film in its true sense and Vijay adds immense value to it by his performance". "IBNLive" named it a "well written Tamil film that engages the audience" and added that it had "the energy of Vijay and intellect of AR Murugadoss". Manoj Kumar from "International Business Times" wrote: "Director AR Murugadoss makes sure that he does not regress with any of his films. He frequently comes out with a different plot and narration style, and ""Thuppaki" is a brilliant example of this." Sify's critic stated that Murugadoss "has made a complete entertainer that blends with Vijayâ€™s mass image, thanks to his racy script", calling it a "perfect Diwali entertainer". Sangeetha Devi Dundoo from "The Hindu" commented: "One of the first promos of the film, with snapshots of Mumbai, lurking terror, the antagonist threatening Vijay to which he responds â€˜I am waitingâ€™ went viral on social networks. The wait, clearly, has been worth it for the audience. And the man whoâ€™s probably having the last laugh is Murugadoss". OneIndia rated the film 3 out of 5 and said, "Vijay is stupendous in the role of an army officer. He brings a lot of energy to his character and thrills the audience in action sequences. Kajal Aggarwal looks good. Vidyut Jamwal has done decent job and Satyan is good". In contrast, Pavithra Srinivasan of Rediff rated it 2.5 out of 5, saying "Vijay fans will find plenty to rejoice in this subdued avatar of their star, but audiences who seek intelligence in their movies will find it rather dull". Vivek Ramz from in.com rated it 3 out of 5 and said that it "doesn't meet the huge expectations it had created for itself", calling it "another regular commercial film which entertains in bits and pieces". 
The Telugu version also met with positive reviews from critics. Jeevi of idlebrain.com gave 3.25/5, naming it a "stylish and slick entertainer", going on to add: "The director has stuck with the main theme and didnâ€™t dilute it for the sake of masala. It is a subject that has pan-India appeal and itâ€™s an intelligent game between two individuals who are working for and against the country". Mahesh K S of 123telugu.com gave 3.5/5 claiming that it was "one film which has everything going right for it. A stylish Vijay, some exceptional thrilling moments and edge of the seat action makes this film surely worth a watch". Oneindia Entertainment stated: "Vijay has improved his performance and body language to suit the Telugu nativity. Because of the director's exceptional ideas, the action scenes, kidnap scenes and mind games worked out well. Kajal Aggarwal did not have much scope to perform but did her part well, as she was almost limited to dance sequences. Vidyut Jamwal did a very good job as a bad guy. "Thuppakki" is a good action-thriller".

Controversies.
"Thuppakki"'s first look poster, depicting Vijay holding a cigar in his mouth, created a stir, since the Government of India had imposed a rule that later films should not feature scenes relating to tobacco or smoking. Director Murugadoss however defended the poster, saying that it was only for promotional purposes and that the film had no such scenes.
A city court stayed advertisements of "Thuppakki", on a civil suit filed by a former assistant director who has claimed that he had already registered a title "Kalla Thuppakki" along with the logo now being used in the "Thuppakki"'s advertisements.
The II assistant judge of the city civil court granted stay until July 16 after C Ravi, an assistant director-turned producer, complained that though he has registered a title "Kalla Thuppakki" and has been renewing it every year since 2009, the producers of the had been using a similar title and a gun logo infringing on his rights.
Noting that he had renewed the title last on April 27, Ravi said that as per norms a title registered with any of the three bodies; Tamil Film Producers Council, the Film and Television Producers Guild of South India and the South Indian Film Chamber of Commerce, cannot be used by another producer unless the original title-holder issues a no-objection certificate. Kalaipuli S Dhanu filed a counter affidavit denying the accusations made against them and said that Thuppakki and Kallathuppakki are not the same and the comparison should not be drawn between the titles. "Thuppakki means a licensed weapon and Kallathuppakki means an unlicensed weapon," he pleaded. The case eventually came to an end on October 5, when the crew of "Kalla Thuppaki" withdrew the court case.
Another promotional poster, which depicted a police-uniform clad Vijay carrying Kajal Aggarwal on his hands was claimed to have been lifted from a poster of the 1982 film "An Officer and a Gentleman" which depicted its lead, actor Richard Gere lifting actress Debra Winger. Murugadoss claimed that "Thuppaki" did not have an army backdrop like Gere's film but was set in Mumbai instead, going on to assert that everything in his film was original. He however admitted to "stealing" the poster of "An Officer and a Gentleman", and stated, "Sometimes, you admire something so much that sub-consciously it becomes a part of your work".
Upon release, an Islamic group violently protested against the film, claiming that it portrayed Muslims as terrorists and traitors. Murugadoss, producer S. Dhanu and Vijay's father S A Chandrasekar later tendered an open apology to representatives of 23 different Muslim outfits, and agreed to delete the scenes to which objections were raised, after activists had gathered near Vijay's residence at Neelankarai and raised slogans against him and the film in Arabic and Urdu. In response to the Muslim protests, S. A. Chandrashekaran said, "We did not intend to hurt the sentiments of Muslims. I want Vijay to be in the hearts of all mothers. My son and I respect all religions. At this juncture, I wish to state that Vijay will play a Muslim in his next film."

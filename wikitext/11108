Set at the International Secret Intelligence Service (ISIS), suave master spy Sterling Archer deals with global espionage; a domineering, late middle-aged mother/boss, Malory Archer; his ex-girlfriend, Agent Lana Kane, ISIS accountant Cyril Figgis; and a less-than-masculine code name—"Duchess".
Episode list.
Season 3 (2011–12).
It was announced on March 29, 2011 that "Archer" was renewed for 16 more episodes. FX had originally intended the first three episodes of Season 3 to air in the fall of 2011 as a "Special Assignment" three-part event, with a further 13 episodes (a normal sized season for most FX shows) to air at the beginning of 2012. Series creator Adam Reed later clarified the situation. He explained that while FX had intended the second set of episodes to be 13 episodes, he had believed that he was only going to be producing a further 10 episodes (with the first three episodes completing the standard order of 13 episodes). While he attempted to produce the full 16 episodes after he realized his error, it soon became clear that it would be impossible to produce three additional episodes. The order was eventually reduced to 13 episodes.
Season 4 (2013).
On February 23, 2012, it was announced FX had ordered a 13-episode 4th season of "Archer", and signed a multi-year deal with Adam Reed and Matt Thompson's Floyd County Productions. Aisha Tyler also confirmed Archer was returning for a fourth season early in 2013 while appearing as a guest on "Rove LA". The first episode premiered on January 17, 2013.

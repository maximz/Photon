This is a list of events held and scheduled by the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC), a mixed martial arts promotion based in the United States. UFC's first event "UFC 1", took place on November 12, 1993. Each UFC event contains several fights. Traditionally, five fights take place on the televised main card, whilst others are held on the unaired preliminary portion and are also aired on the live broadcast if time permits.
Overview.
Occasionally, the UFC holds a live "UFC Prelim" show, prior to their pay-per-view events, which airs at least two of the event's preliminary fights live on FX or Fuel TV. As of UFC 100, typically most UFC events have held 11 fights in total at each event, though sometimes there can be more than 11 or fewer, due to last-minute injuries. Prior to UFC 83, it was common to see 9 fights per event take place.
Many of the "numbered" events have taken place on pay-per-view, though there have been a few exceptions for reasons such as tape-delay. Events such as UFC 72, which took place in Belfast, United Kingdom, were sold on pay-per-view, but due to tape-delay, purchase rates were not as high as events that aired at a traditional starting time. UFC 72 had a buyrate of 200,000 viewers; a figure so low that it would not be matched as of October 2010. As such, many events taking part in significantly different timezones, such as UFC 120 in the United Kingdom, were given a same-night airing in American primetime on Spike TV.
In July 2009, the UFC held its unofficial 100th "numbered event"; however, officially, despite being called UFC 100, it was actually the 101st due to UFC 37.5. The UFC signed a deal with Fox Sports Net, after Fox agreed to broadcast one fight in June 2002, during its "All-Star Summer" that month. UFC 37 and 38 had already been scheduled and promoted, but as UFC 38 was the promotion's debut in the United Kingdom, they created UFC 37.5; an event that became the first ever mixed martial arts fight available on cable television.
As of UFC 157: Rousey vs. Carmouche, which took place on February 23, 2013, there have been 229 UFC events held in 84 cities, within twelve countries and 32 U.S. states or territories. Upcoming events are listed in "Italic".

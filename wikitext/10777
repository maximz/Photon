Kepler-37b is an extrasolar planet (exoplanet) orbiting Kepler-37 in the constellation Lyra. , it is the smallest extrasolar planet ever discovered around a main sequence star, with a mass and radius slightly greater than that of Earth's Moon.
Discovery.
Kepler-37b, along with two other planets, Kepler-37c and Kepler-37d, were discovered by the Kepler space telescope, which observes stellar transits. After observing transits of the planet, astronomers had to compare it with the size of the parent star using asteroseismology, which allowed the size of the planet to be determined "with extreme accuracy". Kepler-37 is currently the smallest star to be studied using this process. To date, the planet is the smallest discovered around a main sequence star outside the solar system. A planet like Kepler-37b having been discovered suggests, to Jack Lissauer, a scientist at NASA's Ames Research Center, that "such little planets are common".
Physical properties.
The planet, about 210 light-years away from Earth, is slightly larger than the Earth's moon, with a diameter of about . NASA states that the planet probably has no atmosphere and cannot support life. Furthermore, the planet is most likely composed of rocky materials. Because it is so close to its star, the planet's mean temperature is estimated to be around .
Orbital properties.
The innermost known planet in its system, Kepler-37b, orbits its parent star at a distance of about 15 million kilometers (9.3 million miles), with a period of roughly 13 days. The outer two planets in the system have orbital periods within one percent of 8:5 and 3:1 commensurabilities (integer ratios) to Kepler-37b's period.

According to the series' creators, about half of "Book Two" will take place in Republic City and the other half will take place in other areas of the world. In a panel discussion at San Diego Comic-Con 2012, Konietzko and DiMartino indicated that "Book Two" will take place six months after the first twelve episodes. They said that it will partially take place at the South Pole, in the Southern Water Tribe, and focus on the mystical "Spirit World" (hence the title "Spirits") and the history of the Avatar lineage and mythology. New characters to be introduced include Tenzin's older sister Kya, Korra's paternal uncle and Korra's first cousins from the Northern Water Tribe, who are all waterbenders as well.

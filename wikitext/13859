Production.
The series was commissioned by NBC, but with the blessing of NBC chief and Universal studio executive Robert Greenblatt, the pilot with proposed title "It's Messy" was released from NBC's projects on January 27, 2012. Universal then sent the script to Fox executives who read it over that following weekend. On May 7, 2012, Fox greenlighted the pilot.
On May 9, 2012, Fox placed a series order for the comedy. Two days later, the title was changed from "It's Messy" to "The Mindy Project." On August 27, 2012, the pilot episode was made available to view online on various sites including Fox, in an attempt to garner interest in the series.
On November 20, 2012, it was reported that Amanda Setton's role had been eliminated and that Anna Camp had been downgraded to a recurring cast member. Stephen Tobolowsky's role was also eliminated, with his character retiring in the eighth episode. Beth Grant, who guest starred as Nurse Beverly in episode two, will be returning as a series regular. Ike Barinholtz was also upgraded to series regular.

A cyst is a closed sac, having a distinct membrane and division compared to the nearby tissue. It may contain air, fluids, or semi-solid material. A collection of pus is called an abscess, not a cyst. Once formed, a cyst could go away on its own or may have to be removed through surgery.
Types.
Cystic fibrosis.
Despite being described in 1938 as the microscopic appearance of cysts in the pancreas, cystic fibrosis is an example of a genetic disorder whose name is related to fibrosis of the cystic duct and does not involve actual cysts.
Treatment.
Treatment ranges from simple enucleation of the cyst to curettage to resection. There are cysts, e.g. buccal bifurcation cyst with self-resolation nature, in which close observation only can be employed unless the cyst is infected and symptomatic.

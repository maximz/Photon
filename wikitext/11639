Early life.
William Adams was born in East Los Angeles, and raised in the Estrada Courts housing projects in the Boyle Heights neighborhood, where he and his family were several of the few African Americans living in a predominantly Hispanic community. He never met his father, William Adams, and grew up with his mother, Debra (Cain), who encouraged him to be unique and to avoid conforming to the tendencies of the other youth in his neighborhood on the eastside of Los Angeles. She encouraged him to begin working on his musical career by sending him to public schools in affluent West Los Angeles. While attending Palisades Charter High School, will.i.am became best friends with Allan Pineda (stage name apl.de.ap), who was also a future member of The Black Eyed Peas. While still in high school, will.i.am and apl.de.ap performed in East L.A. clubs and were soon joined by three other entertainers to form the socially conscious rap group, Atban Klann. Atban Klann caught the eye of Compton rapper Eazy-E and was signed to his label, Ruthless Records.
Adams used to attend raves while in high school. He later said his history with rave culture is why he chose a more electro sound for The Black Eyed Peas' albums "The E.N.D." and "The Beginning". Despite the use of electro and house music elements, will.i.am prefers to separate the underground from pop. In an article with "Los Angeles Times", he mentions that secrecy over the whereabouts of raves is what made "raving" special, and different from the mainstream.
Music career.
1988–2000: Formations and The Black Eyed Peas.
will.i.am's music career began in the summer of 1987, when as an eighth-grader, he met up with fellow rapper Allan Pineda (apl.de.ap) and fellow student Dante Santiago. They began performing together around Los Angeles and were soon discovered by rapper/entrepreneur Eazy-E, who signed them to his label Ruthless Records in 1992. At the time, Will was known as "Will 1X". The Atban Klann's first ever official track, "Merry Muthafuckin' Xmas", was included on Eazy-E's EP "". After this, the trio began recording an album, "Grass Roots", with the help of producers Mookie Mook and DJ Motiv8, however, the album was never released, due to Eazy-E's death in 1995. After Eazy's tragic death, Atban Klann changed their name to the Black Eyed Pods, and Will replaced Dante with Jaime Gomez, better known under his stage name of Taboo. In 1997, they once again changed their name, this time to The Black Eyed Peas, and began recording their first album, "Behind the Front", with the help of soul singer Kim Hill. They were soon signed to Interscope Records, and released their debut single, "Joints & Jam", in early 1998. The album was successful enough for the group's contract to be renewed, and in 2000, a second album, "Bridging the Gap", was released.
2000–03: "Lost Change", "Elephunk" and "Must B 21".
Following the release of "Bridging The Gap", Will began recording his first solo release, "Lost Change", which was the official soundtrack to the film of the same name. Featuring collaborations with Medusa, Planet Asia and Terry Dexter, the album was a critical success.
In November 2001, work began on a third Black Eyed Peas album, "Elephunk". Development of the album began on November 2, 2001 and was released just under two years later in 2003. At the time of development, only will.i.am, apl.de.ap and Taboo were to feature on the album. During the production of "Shut Up" (the second single released from the album), they realized that a female vocal would work well with the song. Originally, Nicole Scherzinger (lead singer of the Pussycat Dolls) was approached to make a guest appearance on the record. She was forced to decline because she already was signed to a contract with Eden's Crush. Danté Santiago then introduced Fergie to Will who was impressed with her vocal talents. She immediately formed a bond with the band and became a permanent member of the Peas and her photo was printed onto the album cover. Nine out of the fourteen tracks were composed by lyricist Robbie Fisher, who has been working closely with the band since the beginning stages of the album. In the United States, "Elephunk" reached number 14 on the "Billboard Top 200" and is their first album to chart in the top 15. It gained even more commercial success in the UK Album Charts where it reached number 3. It has sold over 1.6 million copies in the UK and 8.5 million copies worldwide. The singles "Where Is The Love?" and "Shut Up" reached number 1. "Hey Mama" has been used for several advertisements including advertisements for Apple and iTunes. "Let's Get It Started" also received universal acclaim in the media section where a cover version of the song appears in the film "Hot Tub Time Machine". After the success of "Elephunk", the Peas were approached by EA games to feature some of their music on the 2004 game "". They remixed some of the tracks on Elephunk and translated it into Simlish and created new tracks for the game. They also feature in the game as playable characters.
The group released their breakthrough single, "Where Is The Love", in November 2002 (featuring Justin Timberlake, although he did not appear in the video). On the strength of that single and follow-up singles like "Shut Up", "Elephunk" went on to sell 8.5 million copies worldwide. During this time, Will recorded a second solo album, "Must B 21". In 2002, Will recorded the song "Secrets" for the soundtrack to "", a film accompaniment to the Cartoon Network series. Prior to this, he had also composed the theme music for another Genndy Tartakovsky series, Samurai Jack.
2003–06: "Monkey Business".
In November 2003, work began on a fourth Black Eyed Peas album, entitled "Monkey Business", the second album with new band member Fergie. Upon the success of "Monkey Business", which was released in 2005, the album was certified three times Platinum by the RIAA in the U.S. and has sold over 10 million copies worldwide. The Canadian Recording Industry Association (or CRIA) has certified "Monkey Business" 6x Platinum, with sales of over 600,000 copies. The Australian Recording Industry Association (or ARIA) has also certified "Monkey Business" 6x Platinum, denoting sales of over 420,000 copies. The album's tracks earned the group four 2006 Grammy Award nominations and they also won the Grammy for Best Rap Performance by a Duo or Group for "Don't Phunk with My Heart". According to IFPI, over 2 million copies have been sold in Europe. In the UK alone, it has sold over 1 million copies, although this is significantly lower than their sales of "Elephunk", which stand at over 1.6 million copies and 10 million worldwide.
the band announced they were going to take a break to focus on their own personal projects. Will went on to produce Ferguson's first solo album, "The Dutchess", which was released in 2006, before beginning work with Michael Jackson, who had requested Will's expertise for the recording and production of his new album. Work began on the Jackson album in 2006, and continued until the singer's death in 2009, at which point Will revealed that none of the material recorded during the period would be released. However, remixes recorded for Jackson's "Thriller 25" anniversary album were released in 2008.

The WWE Championship is a professional wrestling world heavyweight championship in WWE. It is one of the world titles in WWE, complementing the World Heavyweight Championship. It is the first world title established in WWE, having been introduced in 1963 as the World Wide Wrestling Federation (WWWF) World Heavyweight Championship. After ending its affiliation with the National Wrestling Alliance (NWA) the promotion was renamed World Wrestling Federation (WWF) with the title also renamed to reflect the acronym.
In 2001, it was unified with the World Championship (formerly the WCW Championship) following the WWF's buyout of World Championship Wrestling (WCW) and became the Undisputed Championship. In 2002, the WWF was renamed World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) and split its roster into two franchises, Raw and SmackDown, in a brand extension. The title was then designated to the SmackDown brand, while WWE established an alternate world title known as the World Heavyweight Championship for the Raw brand. The WWE Undisputed Championship has been known as the WWE Championship since.
The championship is generally contested in professional wrestling matches, in which participants usually execute scripted finishes rather than contend in direct competition. Some reigns were held by champions using a ring name, while others used their real name. The first champion was Buddy Rogers, who won the championship in 1963. The current champion is The Rock, who is in his eighth reign. The champion with the single longest reign is Bruno Sammartino with a reign of 2803 days. Overall, there have been 43 different official champions, with John Cena having the most reigns at ten. Only seven men in history have held the championship for a continuous reign of one year (365 days) or more. They are Bruno Sammartino, Bob Backlund, Hulk Hogan, Pedro Morales, Randy Savage, John Cena and CM Punk.

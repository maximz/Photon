"Doctor Who" is a British science fiction television programme produced by the BBC. As of 25 December 2012, 790 individual episodes, including one television movie of "Doctor Who", have been aired, encompassing 231 stories. Additionally, four charity specials and two animated serials have also been aired. The show's high episode count resulted in "Doctor Who" holding the world record for the highest number of episodes for a science-fiction programme. For comparison, the Guinness World Record holder for the highest number of consecutive episodes, "Smallville", aired 218 episodes.
"Doctor Who" ceased airing in 1989 and began again in 2005. Each story in the original series (1963â€“89) is a multi-episode serial, with two exceptions: the 1965 cutaway episode "Mission to the Unknown"; and the 20th anniversary story "The Five Doctors". The characters in the column after the serial titles indicate the code used by the production team to designate the serial, where applicable, and are followed either by the titles of the individual episodes where given or by the number of episodes otherwise. Unless otherwise noted, episodes in this period are 25 minutes long. During the early seasons of the programme most serials were linked together and one would usually lead directly into the next. Starting with the 2005 revival, the production team abandoned the traditional serial format for a largely self-contained episodic format with occasional multi-part stories and loose story arcs. Unless otherwise noted, the new episodes are 45 minutes long.
Due to the BBC's 1970s junking policy, 106 episodes from the 1960s are missing, with the result that 27 serials are incomplete, although all of these still exist as audio recordings, and some have been reconstructed. In the first two seasons and most of the third, each episode of a serial had an individual title; no serial had an overall on-screen title until "The Savages". The serial titles given below are the most common title for the serials as a whole, used in sources such as the "Doctor Who" Reference Guide and the BBC's classic episode guide, and are generally those used for commercial release. The practice of individually titled episodes resurfaced with the show's 2005 revival, when "Doctor Who" serial nature was abandoned in favour of an episodic format.
The three-digit story numbers are not official designations but are merely to serve as a guide to where the story stands in the overall context of the programme. There is some dispute about, for example, whether to count Season 23's "The Trial of a Time Lord" as one or four serials, and whether the uncompleted "Shada" should be included. The numbering scheme used here reflects the current internal practice of describing "Planet of the Dead" (2009) as the 200th story, used in the official magazine's 407th issue. Other sources, such as the Region 1 DVDs of classic "Doctor Who" serials, use different numbering schemes which diverge after the 108th story, "The Horns of Nimon" (1979/80).
First Doctor.
The first incarnation of the Doctor was portrayed by William Hartnell. During Hartnell's tenure, the Doctor visited a mixture of stories set in the future and in historical events that had no extraterrestrial influence, such as fifteenth century Mesoamerica. In his last story, "The Tenth Planet", the Doctor gradually grew weaker to the point of collapsing at the end of the fourth episode, leading to his regeneration.
Season 1 (1963/64).
Verity Lambert was producer with David Whitaker serving as script editor.
Season 2 (1964/65).
Dennis Spooner replaced David Whitaker as script editor after "The Dalek Invasion of Earth", and edited the remainder of the season apart from "The Time Meddler", which was edited by Donald Tosh.
Season 3 (1965/66).
John Wiles replaced Verity Lambert as producer after "Mission to the Unknown". Innes Lloyd, in turn, replaced Wiles after "The Ark". Donald Tosh continued as script editor until "The Massacre of St Bartholomew's Eve", which was also script-edited by his replacement, Gerry Davis. The practice of giving each individual episode a different title was abandoned after "The Gunfighters", near the end of the season.
Second Doctor.
The Second Doctor was portrayed by Patrick Troughton, whose serials were more action-oriented than those of his predecessor. He retained the role until the last episode of "The War Games" when members of the Doctor's race, the Time Lords, put him on trial for breaking the laws of time and forced him to regenerate.
Season 4 (1966/67) continued.
Peter Bryant joined as associate producer for "The Faceless Ones", and replaced Gerry Davis as script editor for the last four episodes of "The Evil of the Daleks".
Season 5 (1967/68).
Victor Pemberton was script editor for "The Tomb of the Cybermen", with Peter Bryant as producer. After this, Bryant resumed the role of script editor, with Innes Lloyd returning as producer, until "The Web of Fear" when Bryant took over from Lloyd as producer. Derrick Sherwin replaced Bryant as script editor at the same time.
Season 6 (1968/69).
Terrance Dicks took over from Derrick Sherwin as script editor from "The Invasion", with Sherwin resuming the role for "The Space Pirates". Derrick Sherwin took over as producer from Peter Bryant for "The War Games".
Third Doctor.
The Third Doctor was portrayed by Jon Pertwee. Sentenced to exile on Earth and forcibly regenerated at the end of "The War Games", the Doctor spent his time working for UNIT. After "The Three Doctors", the Time Lords repealed his exile; however, the Doctor still worked closely with UNIT from time to time. The Third Doctor regenerated into his fourth incarnation as a result of radiation poisoning in the last moments of "Planet of the Spiders".
Season 7 (1970).
Barry Letts took over as producer from Derrick Sherwin after "Spearhead from Space". From this season onwards the programme was produced in colour, although some episodes now exist only in black and white. To accommodate the new production methods the number of episodes in a season was cut: season 6 has 44 episodes; season 7 has 25 episodes. The seasons would continue to have between 20 and 26 episodes until season 22.
Season 8 (1971).

Season 12 (1974/75).
Barry Letts served as producer for "Robot", after which he was succeeded by Philip Hinchcliffe. Robert Holmes took over from Terrance Dicks as script editor. All serials in this season continue directly one after the other, tracing one single problematic voyage of the TARDIS crew. Despite the continuity, each serial is considered its own standalone story.
Season 15 (1977/78).
Graham Williams took over as producer from Philip Hinchcliffe. Robert Holmes was replaced as script editor by Anthony Read during "The Sun Makers".
Season 16 (1978/79).

Season 18 (1980/81).
John Nathan-Turner replaced Graham Williams as producer. Barry Letts returned, as executive producer, for just this season. Christopher H. Bidmead replaced Douglas Adams as script editor. In a return to the format of early seasons, virtually all serials from Seasons 18 through 20 are linked together, often running directly into each other.
Season 18 forms a loose story arc dealing with the theme of entropy. "Full Circle", "State of Decay", and "Warriors' Gate" trace the Doctor's adventures in E-Space; they were released in both VHS and DVD boxsets with the umbrella title "The E-Space Trilogy".
Fifth Doctor.
The Fifth Doctor was portrayed by Peter Davison.

Antony Root took over from Bidmead as script editor for "Four to Doomsday" and "The Visitation", after which he was replaced by Eric Saward. The show moved from its traditional once-weekly Saturday broadcast to being broadcast twice-weekly primarily on Monday and Tuesday, although there were regional variations to the schedule.
"Castrovalva", together with the previous two serials, "The Keeper of Traken" and "Logopolis", form a trilogy involving the return of the Master. They were released on DVD under the banner title "New Beginnings".
Season 20 (1983).
To commemorate the twentieth season, the stories in this season involve the return of previous villains.

Season 22 (1985).
The series moved back to once-weekly Saturday broadcasts. All episodes were 45 minutes long, though they also exist in 25-minute versions. Although there were now only 13 episodes in the season, the total running time remained approximately the same as in previous seasons since the episodes were almost twice as long.
Season 23 (1986).
After an 18-month production hiatus, the series returned. Eric Saward was script editor up to part eight, when Nathan-Turner unofficially took over script editing the remainder of the season because of Saward's departure. The whole season is titled as "The Trial of a Time Lord", and is split into four segments. The segments are commonly referred to by their working titles (listed below) but the season was broadcast as one fourteen-part story and the working titles did not appear on screen. Episode length returned to 25 minutes, but with only fourteen episodes in the season, making the total running time of this season (and subsequent seasons) just over half of the previous seasons, going back to season 7.
Seventh Doctor.
The Seventh Doctor was portrayed by Sylvester McCoy.
Season 24 (1987).
Andrew Cartmel took over as script editor. This season was moved to a Monday schedule.
Season 25 (1988/89).
The series was moved to Wednesdays.
Season 26 (1989).
The final season continued to push the series towards a darker approach, focusing this time more on Ace's personal life as well as The Doctor's past and manipulations. This season set the tone for the Virgin New Adventures novels that followed.
Eighth Doctor.
The Eighth Doctor was portrayed by Paul McGann. The movie is the only television appearance of this Doctor. The only production title held by this story was "Doctor Who". However, producer Philip Segal later suggested "Enemy Within" as an alternative title. Lacking any other specific name, many fans have adopted this to refer to the movie. Fan groups have also used other informal titles. The DVD release is titled "Doctor Who: The Movie".
Ninth Doctor.
In 2005, the BBC relaunched "Doctor Who" after a 16-year absence from episodic television, with Russell T Davies, Julie Gardner and Mal Young as executive producers, Phil Collinson as producer, and Christopher Eccleston taking the lead role of the Ninth Doctor.
The revival adheres to the original continuity. The new series is formatted to a widescreen display ratio, and a standard episode length of 45 minutes. For the first time since the 1965/66 season each episode has an individual title, although most stories do not span more than one episode. The show also returned to its traditional Saturday evening slot.
Series 1 (2005).
The 2005 series constitutes a loose story arc, dealing with the consequences of the Time War and the mysterious Bad Wolf.

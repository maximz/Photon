Production.
Conception and development.
In early 2011 it was announced that Shonda Rhimes was developing a new pilot. In February, Kerry Washington was cast in a leading role. Henry Ian Cusick also landed a role with Washington. On February 28, 2011 it was announced that Tony Goldwyn landed the role as the president. In May 2011, ABC picked up the pilot as a mid-season replacement, During the Winter Television Critics Association Press Tour, it was announced that the show would premiere April 5, 2012 after "Grey's Anatomy", relocating "Private Practice" to Tuesday nights.
The program was renewed for a second season on May 11, 2012, in the same Thursday timeslot, while "Private Practice" remains in the new Tuesday evening timeslot to finish its final season. Rhimes has stated that the second season will likely be thirteen episodes or less.
Critical reception.
To be perfectly honest, after watching four episodes of "Scandal", I'm not 100 percent clear on what it is that Olivia and her team (most of them fellow lawyers who don't practice law) do, nor on exactly what the show is. I'm also not entirely sure that it matters. "Scandal" is a good example of what a show is about being far less important than how it's about it.
All the tropes, cliches and (especially) soap conventions creator Shonda Rhimes has poured so generously into ""Grey's Anatomy"" and ""Private Practice"" over the years have been poured right back into this Beltway potboiler. The hairpin plot twists. The whiplash character reveals. The bumptious moralizing. The Strong Woman/Wronged Woman character type, and its direct corollary, Weak, Middle-Aged, Married Man Who Secretly Likes Hookers. It's all here!
Broadcast.
In the United States "Scandal" airs on ABC on Thursday evenings at 10pm/9pm CT. The program airs at the same time in Canada through the CityTV television system with simsubbing of the ABC feed.

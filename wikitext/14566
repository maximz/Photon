"Hawaii Five-0" is a police procedural series developed for television by Alex Kurtzman, Roberto Orci and Peter M. Lenkov, based on the 1968 series of the same name created by Leonard Freeman. It premiered on CBS on Monday, September 20, 2010, 42 years to the day from the premiere of the original show, September 20, 1968. The title of each episode (except the pilot and "Hookman" in season 3) is in the Hawaiian language rather than in English. On March 14, 2012, CBS renewed "Hawaii Five-0" for a third season, which premiered on September 24.
The series covers the actions of a small special state task force created by the Governor of Hawaii, Gov. Pat Jameson, to investigate serious crimes throughout the Islands, as Hawaii does not have a conventional state police force. The team is headed by Lieutenant Commander Steve McGarrett, USNR (and former Navy SEAL) as it investigates crimes ranging from terrorism to kidnapping. McGarrett chooses as his partner Honolulu PD Detective Danny Williams. He fills out the team by selecting Chin Ho Kelly, and Chin's cousin, a rookie HPD officer named Kono Kalakaua who is fresh from the academy. The task force does not follow the normal chain of command, and instead reports directly to the Governor's office. However, in season two after Gov. Jameson is murdered the new governor, Gov. Sam Demming, does not give them complete immunity.

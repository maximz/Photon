An integer is a number that can be written without a fractional or decimal component. For example, 21, 4, and −2048 are integers; 9.75, 5½, and are not integers. The set of integers is a subset of the real numbers, and consists of the natural numbers (, , , , ...) and the negatives of the non-zero natural numbers (, −2, −3, ...).
The name derives from the Latin "integer" (meaning literally "untouched," hence "whole": the word "entire" comes from the same origin, but via French). The set of all integers is often denoted by a boldface Z (or blackboard bold formula_1, Unicode U+2124 ), which stands for "" (German for "numbers", pronounced ).
The integers (with addition as operation) form the smallest group containing the additive monoid of the natural numbers. Like the natural numbers, the integers form a countably infinite set. In algebraic number theory, these commonly understood integers, embedded in the field of rational numbers, are referred to as rational integers to distinguish them from the more broadly defined algebraic integers. 
Algebraic properties.
Like the natural numbers, Z is closed under the operations of addition and multiplication, that is, the sum and product of any two integers is an integer. However, with the inclusion of the negative natural numbers, and, importantly, 0, Z (unlike the natural numbers) is also closed under subtraction. Z is not closed under division, since the quotient of two integers (e.g., 1 divided by 2), need not be an integer. Although the natural numbers are closed under exponentiation, the integers are not (since the result can be a fraction when the exponent is negative).
The following lists some of the basic properties of addition and multiplication for any integers "a", "b" and "c".
In the language of abstract algebra, the first five properties listed above for addition say that Z under addition is an abelian group. As a group under addition, Z is a cyclic group, since every nonzero integer can be written as a finite sum or . In fact, Z under addition is the "only" infinite cyclic group, in the sense that any infinite cyclic group is isomorphic to Z.
The first four properties listed above for multiplication say that Z under multiplication is a commutative monoid. However not every integer has a multiplicative inverse; e.g. there is no integer "x" such that because the left hand side is even, while the right hand side is odd. This means that Z under multiplication is not a group.
All the rules from the above property table, except for the last, taken together say that Z together with addition and multiplication is a commutative ring with unity. It is the prototype of all objects of such algebraic structure. Only those equalities of expressions are true in Z for all values of variables, which are true in any unital commutative ring. 
At last, the property (*) says that the commutative ring Z is an integral domain. In fact, Z provides the motivation for defining such a structure.
The ring Z is the initial ring with unity, which means that it homomorphically maps to any such ring. Any integer number exists in any unital ring, with all arithmetic equalities on integers satisfied, although certain non-zero integers map to zero for certain rings.
The lack of multiplicative inverses, which is equivalent to the fact that Z is not closed under division, means that Z is "not" a field. The smallest field with the usual operations containing the integers is the field of rational numbers. The process of constructing the rationals from the integers can be mimicked to form the field of fractions of any integral domain. And back, starting from an algebraic number field (an extension of rational numbers), its ring of integers can be extracted, which includes Z as its subring.
Although ordinary division is not defined on Z, the division "with remainder" is defined on them. It is called Euclidean division and possesses the following important property: that is, given two integers "a" and "b" with , there exist unique integers "q" and "r" such that and , where | "b" | denotes the absolute value of "b". The integer "q" is called the "quotient" and "r" is called the "remainder" of the division of "a" by "b". The Euclidean algorithm for computing greatest common divisors works by a sequence of Euclidean divisions.
Again, in the language of abstract algebra, the above says that Z is a Euclidean domain. This implies that Z is a principal ideal domain and any positive integer can be written as the products of primes in an essentially unique way. This is the fundamental theorem of arithmetic.
Order-theoretic properties.
An integer is "positive" if it is greater than zero and "negative" if it is less than zero. Zero is defined as neither negative nor positive.
It follows that Z together with the above ordering is an ordered ring.
The integers are the only integral domain whose positive elements are well-ordered, and in which order is preserved by addition.
Construction.
[[File:Relatives Numbers Representation.png|thumb|alt=Representation of equivalence classes for the numbers −5 to 5
The integers can be formally constructed as the equivalence classes of ordered pairs of natural numbers ("a", "b").
precisely when
It is easily verified that these definitions are independent of the choice of representatives of the equivalence classes.
Every equivalence class has a unique member that is of the form ("n",0) or (0,"n") (or both at once). The natural number "n" is identified with the class [("n",0)] (in other words the natural numbers are embedded into the integers by map sending "n" to [("n",0)]), and the class [(0,"n")] is denoted −"n" (this covers all remaining classes, and gives the class [(0,0)] a second time since 
Thus, [("a","b")] is denoted by
If the natural numbers are identified with the corresponding integers (using the embedding mentioned above), this convention creates no ambiguity.
This notation recovers the familiar representation of the integers as {... −3,−2,−1, 0, 1, 2, 3, ...}.
Integers in computing.
An integer is often a primitive data type in computer languages. However, integer data types can only represent a subset of all integers, since practical computers are of finite capacity. Also, in the common two's complement representation, the inherent definition of sign distinguishes between "negative" and "non-negative" rather than "negative, positive, and 0". (It is, however, certainly possible for a computer to determine whether an integer value is truly positive.) Fixed length integer approximation data types (or subsets) are denoted "int" or Integer in several programming languages (such as Algol68, C, Java, Delphi, etc.).
Variable-length representations of integers, such as bignums, can store any integer that fits in the computer's memory. Other integer data types are implemented with a fixed size, usually a number of bits which is a power of 2 (4, 8, 16, etc.) or a memorable number of decimal digits (e.g., 9 or 10).
Cardinality.
The cardinality of the set of integers is equal to formula_12 (aleph-null). This is readily demonstrated by the construction of a bijection, that is, a function that is injective and surjective from Z to N.
If the domain is restricted to Z then each and every member of Z has one and only one corresponding member of N and by the definition of cardinal equality the two sets have equal cardinality.

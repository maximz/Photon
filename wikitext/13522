The newton (symbol: N) is the International System of Units (SI) derived unit of force. It is named after Isaac Newton in recognition of his work on classical mechanics, specifically Newton's second law of motion.
Definition.
In 1946, at the 8th annual meeting of the Conférence Générale des Poids et Mesures (CGPM), resolution 2 standardized the unit of force in the MKS system of units to be the amount needed to accelerate 1 kilogram of mass at the rate of 1 metre per second squared. The 9th CGPM, held in 1948, then adopted the name "newton" for this unit in resolution 7. This name honors the English physicist and mathematician Isaac Newton, who laid the foundations for most of classical mechanics. The newton thus became the standard unit of force in le Système International d'Unités (SI), or International System of Units.

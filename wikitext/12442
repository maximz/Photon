Crew.
The series was created by Robert King and Michelle King who also serve as executive producers and show runners. The pair had produced the short-lived legal drama "In Justice" that aired as a mid-season replacement in early 2006. The creators had previously worked extensively in feature films. Scott Free productions helped to finance "The Good Wife" and Ridley Scott, Tony Scott (till his death) and David W. Zucker are also credited as executive producers. Executive producer Dee Johnson added television writing experience to the team. Charles McDougall directed the pilot episode and was the pilot's other executive producer. McDougall had previously enjoyed success as the director of the pilot for "Desperate Housewives". All seven executive producers returned when a full series was ordered and they were joined by executive producer Brooke Kennedy. McDougall left the crew after directing and executive producing the second episode. The series is produced by Bernadette Caulfield who had previously worked on the HBO polygamy drama "Big Love". Co-producer Ron Binkowski added post production experience to the pilot and returned for the first season.
Several new producers were added to the crew once CBS ordered a full season. Angela Amato Velez joined the crew as a consulting producer and writer bringing legal experience from her careers as a police officer and legal aid attorney and writing experience from the police dramas "Third Watch" and "Southland". Todd Ellis Kessler, who had recently completed production on "The Unit" and had previously worked on legal drama "The Practice", joined the staff as a co-executive producer and writer. Kessler's fellow "The Unit" producer Ted Humphrey served as a supervising producer and writer and then as co-executive producer and writer. Corinne Brinkerhoff completed the production team as a writer and co-producer. Brinkerhoff had previously worked as a writer and story editor on "Boston Legal".

Reception.
The first season of the show received generally favorable reviews. It scored a Metacritic rating of 76 out of 100 based on the views of 26 critics. In reviewing the first early episodes many critics praised the acting talents of the cast. The "Chicago Tribune" commended the show saying "one of the best parts of the show is Alicia's complicated relationship with her husband, who humiliated his family with a sex scandal but also appears to be a pawn in a larger game being played by high-level politician". The second season of the show was generally better received than the first. It currently sits at 89 out of 100 on Metacritic indicating "universal acclaim". The 4th season also received critical acclaim, with a 86 out 100 on Metacritic, indicating "universal acclaim".
The "New York Daily News" report, in a review of the lead character's performance said "Margulies puts a powerful combination of cold fury, bewilderment and tenacity into Alicia Florrick, the wife of a disgraced Chicago politician in a new series that readily admits it ripped itself from the headlines" while "The Baltimore Sun" predicted that "With all four bringing their 'A' games to the pilot, it looks as if CBS could have another winning 10 o'clock drama."
There were a few reservations as to the long-term success and plot of the show, with the "San Francisco Chronicle" concluding that "There's nothing inherently wrong with "The Good Wife" other than it's a legal series with too many close-up shots of knowing glances and 'attagirl Alicia' moments of empowerment that you saw coming 20 minutes prior".
"Time" magazine's James Poniewozik named it one of the Top 10 TV Series of 2010 and 2011, saying, "The ability to keep growing: that's what makes a good "Wife" great". "The Salt Lake Tribune" in its list of the Top 10 series of 2011 ranked "The Good Wife" No. 3, explaining "The mix of fascinating legal drama and even more fascinating personal drama is superb."
AOL named Alicia the 19th Most Memorable Female TV Character.

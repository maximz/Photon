Circumference is the linear distance around the outside of a closed curve or circular object. The circumference of a circle is of special importance to geometric and trigonometric concepts. However circumference may also describe the outside of elliptical closed curves. Circumference is a special example of perimeter.
Circumference of a circle.
The circumference of a circle is the length around it. The term is used when measuring physical objects, as well as when considering abstract geometric forms.
Relationship with Pi.
The use of the mathematical constant is ubiquitous in mathematics, engineering, and science. While the constant ratio of circumference to radius formula_2 also has many uses in mathematics, engineering, and science, it is not formally named. These uses include but are not limited to radians, computer programming, and physical constants.
Circumference of an ellipse.
The circumference of an ellipse is more difficult to calculate than that of a circle. It involves higher order mathematics. The circumference and diameters of an ellipse are not related in the simple, linear manner of a circle. The exact measurement requires using advanced calculus to find the complete elliptic integral of the second kind. This can be achieved either via numerical integration or binomial series expansions.
Circumference of a graph.
In graph theory the circumference of a graph refers to the longest cycle contained in that graph.

This is a list of the world's largest public and private businesses by its consolidated revenue. The list is limited to companies with annual revenues exceeding 100 billion USD.
The availability and reliability of up to date information on private or state-owned companies is limited and varies from country to country, thus this list may be incomplete. This list is shown in U.S. dollars, but many of the companies on it prepare their accounts in other currencies. The value of their revenue in dollar terms may change substantially in a short period of time due to exchange rate fluctuations.

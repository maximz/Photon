Some of the most renowned actors of the United Kingdom and Ireland have voiced or portrayed characters appearing in the "Harry Potter" film series based on the book series by J. K. Rowling. Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson have played Harry Potter, Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger in all the films. When they were cast only Radcliffe had previously acted in a film. Complementing them on screen are such actors as Helena Bonham Carter, Jim Broadbent, John Cleese, Robbie Coltrane, Warwick Davis, Ralph Fiennes, Michael Gambon, Brendan Gleeson, Richard Griffiths, Richard Harris, John Hurt, Jason Isaacs, Gary Oldman, Alan Rickman, Fiona Shaw, Maggie Smith, Timothy Spall, Imelda Staunton, David Thewlis, Emma Thompson, and Julie Walters, among others. Thirteen actors have appeared as the same character in all eight films of the franchise.
Some well-known British actors who have not appeared in the series, are asked in jest why they have not been cast. When David Yates was directing the fifth film, Bill Nighy, who had previously collaborated with Yates on three of his television projects, said that he joked with Yates that maybe now he wouldn't be the only actor in England who hadn't been in "Harry Potter". "But nobody called", Nighy added. But in 2009, Yates cast Nighy as Minister of Magic Rufus Scrimgeour in "Deathly Hallows". Nighy said, "I am no longer the only English actor not to be in "Harry Potter" and I am very pleased." Jude Law has quipped, "Nobody's asked me. I was a bit too old for Harry". When a reporter compared potions professor Horace Slughorn's obsession with famous names to the series' connection to "every notable British actor," Jim Broadbent, who plays Slughorn said, "Well, not "every" actor gets invited. I know some who are still waiting."
With the exception of Chris Columbus, each director has had a cameo appearance in their respective film: Alfonso Cuar√≥n appears as a wizard holding a candle during a scene at The Three Broomsticks in "Prisoner of Azkaban"; Mike Newell is heard briefly as the radio presenter in Frank Bryce's house in "Goblet of Fire"; and David Yates features as a wizard within a magical moving portrait in "Order of the Phoenix". Producer David Heyman also makes a cameo appearance as a wizard featured within a magical moving portrait in the third film, "Prisoner of Azkaban".
Harry Potter's author J.K.Rowling gave a speech during the final, world premiere of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2 on the 7 July 2011 in London, England. She announced that she could never have dream of the talented actors and actresses who have appeared in all the Harry Potter's movies. Rowling also announced that they are seven Harry Potter's film series cast members, who she refers to has "The Big Seven", they are Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, Emma Watson, Tom Felton, Matthew Lewis, Evanna Lynch and Bonnie Wright. 
The list below is sorted by film and character, as some characters have been portrayed by multiple actors.

Apple provides updates to the iOS operating system for the iPhone, iPad, and iPod Touch through iTunes, and since iOS 5.0, also through over-the-air software updates. With the June 6, 2011 announcement of iOS 5.0, a USB connection to iTunes is no longer needed to activate iOS devices; data synchronization can happen automatically and wirelessly through Apple's iCloud service. The most recent major update, iOS 6, sees the addition of around 200 new features, including Passbook, Apple-sourced maps, and full Facebook integration.
Overview.
Apple's iOS did not have an official name until the release of the iPhone software development kit (iPhone SDK) on March 6, 2008. Before then, Apple marketing literature simply stated that their iPhone runs a version of "OS X", a reference to iOS' parent, Mac OS X. When introduced, it was named "iPhone OS". It was renamed iOS on June 7, 2010, as iPhone was no longer the only device to run iOS. Apple licenses the "iOS" name from Cisco.
Versions.
On June 29, 2007, Apple released the first version of what became iOS â€“ concurrently with the first iPhone. The final 1.x series release was 1.1.5, released shortly before version 2.0.
July 11, 2008 saw the public release of iPhone OS 2.0, with upgrades through version 2.2.1 made available.
June 17, 2009 was the release date for iPhone OS 3.0. It was updated through (and including) version 3.1.3 (release date February 2, 2010). The first generation iPod Touch and iPhone have iPhone OS 3.1.3 as their newest available version. The iPad was introduced with iPhone OS 3.2, later updated to 3.2.2, a version made specifically for the iPad.
On June 21, 2010, iOS 4.0 was released to the public and was made available only to the iPod Touch and iPhone. iOS 4.0 was announced to have over 1500 new APIs for developers, with the highly anticipated multitasking feature. The iPod Touch (2nd generation) and iPhone 3G have iOS 4.2.1 as the final version available. Nevertheless, many features are not available for the iPhone 3G or iPod touch 2nd generation, such as multitasking and home screen backgrounds. iOS 4.2 is the first version to bring major feature parity to the iPhone and iPad. The release of the CDMA iPhone for Verizon Wireless saw a branching of iOS. The 4.2 version sequence continued for the CDMA phone while 4.3 was released for all other products.
On June 6, 2011, Apple previewed iOS 5, Apple TV 4.4 beta and the iOS SDK 5 beta along with iCloud beta among other products. This update introduced iMessage chat between devices running iOS 5, a new notification system, Newsstand subscriptions, Twitter integrated into iOS, Reminders app, Enhancements to AirPlay, full integration with iCloud and over 200 new features. iOS 5.0 supports all iPad models, iPhone 3GS, iPhone 4 GSM & CDMA, and the iPod Touch (3rd & 4th generation).
iOS 5 had very few bugs, causing it to have only three minor additions, 5.0.1, 5.1, and 5.1.1, which were all provided as an OTA software update.
Apple concurrently provides the same version of iOS for the comparable model of iPhone and iPod touch, usually devices released in the same calendar year. iPhone users receive all software updates for free, while iPod Touch users paid for the 2.0 and 3.0 major software updates. As of iOS 4.0, Apple no longer charges for iPod Touch updates.
As of October 23, 2011, two versions of iOS were never released. iOS 1.2, which after the first beta was replaced by a 2.0 version number; the second beta was called 2.0b2 instead of 1.2b2. The other was iOS 4.2, replaced with 4.2.1 due to a Wi-Fi bug in 4.2 beta 3, causing Apple to release 2 more golden masters (4.2 GM and 4.2.1 GM). 
Version history: portable iOS devices.

While the iPhone 4, iPhone 3GS, iPod Touch (3rd & 4th generation) have all features enabled, such as multitasking. The iPhone and iPod Touch (1st generation) cannot run iOS 4.0 and above.

Major software bugs.
iOS 4.x: alarm clock bugs.
The Alarm feature of the built in Clock app in the iPhone and iPod Touch has been plagued by major bugs in all versions of iOS 4. The first bug noticed was the "DST bug" which was first seen when some countries switched to/from daylight saving time from/to standard time in October/November 2010. It caused recurring alarms to start going off an hour too early or late. Apple promised the bug would be fixed in iOS 4.2 but according to some reports it still exists even in iOS 4.3.1.
The second alarm clock bug discovered was the "New Year's Day bug" which showed up on January 1, 2011 as well as January 1, 2012. It caused non-recurring alarms not to go off at all. However two days after each New Year's Day, on January 3, they "magically" started working again. This bug was seemingly fixed in iOS 4.3.
iOS 5.x: battery, Wi-Fi, SIM card, and echo bugs.
Apple has confirmed that several battery life bugs are negatively affecting battery life in iOS 5. They attempted to fix these bugs with iOS 5.0.1 but the problem still remained.
The launch of the iOS 5 update on October 12, 2011 (including iOS 5.0.1 released on November 10, 2011) led many users to report a major bug causing the device to lose Wi-Fi access. This problem has supposedly been fixed with the release of iOS 5.1.1
Some users of the iPhone 4S and iPad reported issues with the SIM card in the initial release of iOS 5, and even though Apple attempted to fix these issues in version 5.0.1 build 9A406 (for iPhone 4S only), they still remain.
Some users of the iPhone 4/4S reported issues with having echo problems during phone call in the initial release of iOS 5, which causes echoes to appear randomly during phone calls made through earphones. The other party in the call is generally unable to hear the conversation due to this problem. The owners reported a "fix" that is to switch to speaker mode when echo happens then switch back (turn speaker off), which would get rid of the echo temporarily, but it might happen again within the same phone call. It is unclear that whether Apple attempted to fix this issue in version 5.0.1, but for many users this problem still remains after updating to 5.0.1. It appears that the new noise-cancelling microphone/technology might be the reason behind this bug.Apple has since released version 5.1.1 in an attempt to fix the problem.
iOS 6: Maps, Bluetooth, Location-based reminders, Do Not Disturb bug.
Apple has admitted that there were several bugs in the mapping app on iOS 6, with cities in the wrong location, some places being missed off altogether, some places misnamed and places of interest in the sea.
Many users report a problem with Bluetooth audio streaming to a range of compatible devices. The sound cuts out every now and then for no apparent reason. , no solution has been provided by Apple.
Location-based reminders do not work for iPads, even though they were promised to work on cellular enabled devices.
A lot of users are reporting problems with the iPhone 5 not reconnecting to the cellular network, when having lost connection for more than 5 minutes and staying at no service. , no solution has been provided by Apple and the problem was not solved with the 6.0.1 iOS release.
Many iPhone users experienced a bug with the Do Not Disturb feature when the calendar changed from 2012 to 2013. The feature would be left on past the scheduled time set by the user, allowing texts, notifications, and alarm settings to be missed. The bug was caused by a difference in formatting in the ISO calendar system versus the Gregorian calendar system. Apple did not offer a quick software update for the bug, instead saying that the bug would fix itself on January 7, 2013.
iOS 6.1.2.
Three major bugs have been identified in iOS 6.1. 
The first was addressed when iOS 6.1.1 was released that "fixes an issue that could impact cellular performance and reliability for iPhone 4S". 
The second causes issues when iOS devices connect to a Microsoft Exchange server to retrieve email and it results in "mailbox server resources are consumed, log growth becomes excessive, memory and CPU use may increase significantly, and server performance is affected". Microsoft have suggested several workarounds, and Apple has responded with a KnowledgeBase article describing the cause of the bug and a suggested temporary workaround, while promising a fix in the near future.
The third allows anyone with physical access to an iPhone running this version of the OS to bypass the lock screen and temporarily gain full access to the Phone app, simply by performing a specific sequence of actions on the phone.
Version history: Apple TV (2nd generation) onwards.
Information about new updates to Apple TV (2nd generation) onwards is published on Apple's knowledge base.
iOS 4.x.
iOS 4.1 was the first version of iOS available on the Apple TV (2nd generation). It included Apple TV Software 4.0.
iOS 5.x.

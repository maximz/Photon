"The Farm" is the seventeenth episode of the ninth season of the American comedy television series "The Office".
Production.
The episode was written by Rainn Wilson and former showrunner Paul Lieberstein. This marks the first time that Wilson has written an episode for the series, and the third time that a lead for the show has written—sans staff writers B. J. Novak, Mindy Kaling, and Lieberstein—after Steve Carell penned the second season finale "Casino Night" and the fourth season entry "Survivor Man".
"The Farm" was the fifth episode produced, but will be the seventeenth aired, as noted by its production number. It was originally supposed to act as a backdoor pilot for a spin-off series starring Wilson and focusing on Dwight. As such, Wilson was initially slated to appear in only 13 episodes of "The Office"s ninth season before leaving for the spin-off. Paul Lieberstein, the showrunner for "The Office" for seasons five through eight, stepped down at the start of season nine in order to focus more energy on the potential spin-off. However, upon review, the spin-off was not picked up by NBC. Executive producer Greg Daniels revealed that the episode will have additional material shot so that it fits better into the season, as the original version contained "certain aspects that were appropriate for a pilot of a new show".
The episode guest stars Matt L. Jones, Tom Bower, Majandra Delfino, and Thomas Middleditch as members of Dwight's family. Jones portrays Dwight's cousin Zeke, Bower plays Dwight's uncle Heinrich, Delfino plays Dwight's sister Frannie, and Middleditch portrays Dwight's brother Jeb. Jones had previously appeared in the ninth season entry, "Junior Salesman".

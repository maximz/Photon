Japan Airlines Flight 2 was a flight that was piloted by Captain Kohei Asoh on November 22, 1968. The DC-8 plane was scheduled to land at San Francisco International Airport but due to heavy fog and other factors, Asoh mistakenly landed the plane in the waters of San Francisco Bay, two and a half miles short of the runway. None of the 96 passengers or 11 crew were injured in the mishap. The plane was recovered 55 hours after the incident. It was transported to San Francisco International Airport on a barge. United Airlines refurbished the aircraft for service and returned the aircraft to JAL, March 31, 1969. The flight is still in operation today and it still flies from Tokyo (Haneda) to San Francisco using a Boeing 777 instead of a Douglas DC8; the flight previously operated from Narita up until October 2010.
Captain Kohei Asoh.
Captain Asoh was a veteran pilot with about 10,000 hours of flight time. During World War II he served as a flight instructor for the Japanese military.
"Asoh defense".
In his 1988 book "The Abilene Paradox", author Jerry B. Harvey said that Asoh, when asked how he had managed to land the aircraft in the bay, replied "Asoh fuck up." Harvey termed this frank acceptance of blame the "Asoh defense", and the story and term have been taken up by a number of other management theorists.

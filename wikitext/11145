Along with the Simpson family, "The Simpsons" includes a large array of characters: co-workers, teachers, family friends, extended relatives, townspeople, local celebrities, and fictional characters. The creators originally intended many of these characters as one-time jokesters or for fulfilling needed functions in the town. A number of them have gained expanded roles and subsequently starred in their own episodes. According to creator Matt Groening, the show adopted the concept of a large supporting cast from the Canadian sketch comedy show "Second City Television".
The main characters, the Simpson family, are listed first; all other characters are listed in alphabetical order. Only main, supporting, and recurring characters are listed. For one-time characters, see "List of one-time characters in The Simpsons".

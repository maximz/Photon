Parasitic aliens called "souls" have invaded the Earth and have begun to possess the minds of humans. Melanie Stryder's body has been inhabited by a soul named Wanderer, but she refuses to fade away.

Melanie is trapped inside Wanderer's mind, speaking to her mentally, when both decide to set off and find Melanie's loved ones.

Producers Nick Wechsler, Steve Schwartz, and Paula Mae Schwartz acquired the film rights to The Host in September 2009, but Open Road Films later acquired the film rights, and made Stephenie Meyer, Nick Wechsler, Steve Schwartz, and Paula Mae Schwartz the main producers. Andrew Niccol was hired to write the screenplay and to direct the film. In February 2011, Susanna White was hired to replace Niccol as director, but he later resumed the role in May 2011. Saoirse Ronan was also cast in May as Melanie Stryder/Wanderer. On June 27, the release date was set for the film for March 29, 2013, and it was also announced that principal photography would begin in February 2012, in Louisiana and New Mexico. The film received a PG-13 rating from the Motion Picture Association of America for "some sensuality and violence."

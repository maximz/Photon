N (named "en" ) is the fourteenth letter in the ISO basic Latin alphabet.
History of the forms.
One of the most common hieroglyphs, snake, was used in Egyptian writing to stand for a sound like the English ⟨J⟩, because the Egyptian word for "snake" was "djet". It is speculated by many that Semitic people working in Egypt adapted hieroglyphics to create the first alphabet, and that they used the same snake symbol to represent N, because their word for "snake" may have begun with that sound. However, the name for the letter in the Phoenician, Hebrew, Aramaic and Arabic alphabets is "nun", which means "fish" in some of these languages. The sound value of the letter was —as in Greek, Etruscan, Latin and all modern languages.
Usage.
N represents a dental or alveolar nasal in virtually all languages that use the Latin alphabet, and in the International Phonetic Alphabet. A common digraph with 'n' is 'ng', which represents a velar nasal in a variety of languages, usually positioned word-finally in English. Often, before a velar plosive (as in "ink" or "jungle"), 'n' alone represents a velar nasal. In Italian and French, 'gn' represents a palatal nasal (). The Portuguese and Vietnamese spelling for this sound is 'nh', while Spanish and a few other languages use the letter 'ñ'. In English, 'n' is generally silent when it is preceded by an 'm' at the end of words, as in "hymn"; however, 'n' is pronounced in this combination when occurring word medially, as in "hymnal".
'n' is the sixth most common letter and the second-most commonly used consonant in the English language (after 't').
In mathematics, the italic form ("n") is the common symbol for a variable quantity, especially one which represents an integer. formula_1 is often used to refer to the set of natural numbers.
In chemistry, N represents the element Nitrogen. In biochemistry, N is the one-letter code symbol for the amino acid asparagine. It is also the symbol for the SI unit of force, the newton.

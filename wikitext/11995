On May 10, 2012, ABC renewed "Modern Family" for a fourth season. Two months later, after the show received 14 Emmy Award nominations, series creators Steven Levitan and Christopher Lloyd shared some of the story lines with TVLine. The season premiere "is kind of picking up right where we left off, with Gloria's announcement to the audience that sheâ€™s pregnant," says Levitan. "Everybody, as you can imagine, has big reactions to this news, and the whole episode is about that."
Mitch and Cam will be dealing with the contrast between their unsuccessful attempts to adopt a second child during the third season and Gloria's unintended pregnancy. The baby will be born about midway through the season.
Haley will remain involved in the show even though she is in college. "She stays in touch, and she visits home; it's kind of a typical first-year-in-college experience, in that she feels a little bit of loneliness and adjustment," according to Lloyd. "She wants her family, but doesn't want her family." Cameron will be returning to teaching middle school "to kind of fill his void a little bit."
Production.
Filming for the fourth season began on July 30, 2012, and the season premiered on Wednesday, September 26, 2012. The series follows the lives of 3 different families: husbands Mitchell and Cameron, and their daughter Lily; Claire, Phil, and their three children, Alex, Haley, and Luke; and Jay, his second wife Gloria, her son Manny and now the new baby Fulgencio Joe. The show is currently on its fourth season and continues to air regularly.

Reception.
Critical.
The series has received favorable reviews from critics. It holds a Metacritic score of 66/100, indicating "generally favorable" reviews.
Verne Gay of "Newsday" gave the show a 5 star rating, noting "The cast is good, even excellent. But Perry's the one who sells "Go On"." David Hinckley of the "New York Daily News" described the show as "Maybe the best new sitcom of the fall."
Hank Stuever of the "Washington Post" praised the directing of the show, observing ""Go On" moves quite breezily--much like an NBC-flavored take on premium cable dramadies such as "The Big C" and "Enlightened". It's not as good as either of those, but it has the same happy-sad aura, with just a dash of "Community"-like absurdity to keep the speed limit up." 
International broadcasts.
The series airs on Global in Canada, and is simulcast with the NBC airings. The Dutch Comedy Central began airing the series on December 2, 2012.

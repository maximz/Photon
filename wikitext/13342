World War II was the deadliest military conflict in history. Over 60 million people were killed, which was over 2.5% of the world population. The tables below give a detailed country-by-country count of human losses.
Total dead.
World War II fatality statistics vary, with estimates of total dead ranging from 50 million to over 70 million. The sources cited in this article document an estimated death toll in World War II that range from approximately 60 to 80 million, making it the deadliest war in world history in absolute terms of total dead but not in terms of deaths relative to the world population.
When scholarly sources differ on the number of deaths in a country, a range of war losses is given, in order to inform readers that the death toll is disputed. Civilians killed totaled from 38 to 55 million, including 13 to 20 million from war-related disease and famine. Total military dead: from 22 to 25 million, including deaths in captivity of about 5 million prisoners of war.
Recent historical scholarship.
Recent historical scholarship has shed new insight into the topic of Second World War casualties. Research in Russia since the collapse of the Soviet Union has caused a revision of estimates of Soviet war dead. Estimated USSR losses within postwar borders now stand at 26.6 million. In August 2009 the Polish Institute of National Remembrance (IPN) researchers estimated Poland's dead at between 5.6 and 5.8 million.
The German Army historian Rüdiger Overmans published a study in 2000 that estimated German military dead and missing at 5.3 million. War dead totals in this article for the British Commonwealth are based on the research of the Commonwealth War Graves Commission. Casualties listed here include about 4 to 12 million war-related famine deaths in China, Indonesia, Vietnam, the Philippines, India that are often omitted from other compilations of World War II casualties.
Classification of casualties.
Some nations in World War II suffered disproportionally more casualties than others. This is especially true regarding civilian casualties. The following chart gives data on the number of dead for each country, along with population information to show the relative impact of losses. Military figures include battle deaths (KIA) and personnel missing in action (MIA), as well as fatalities due to accidents, disease and deaths of prisoners of war in captivity. Civilian casualties include deaths caused by strategic bombing, Holocaust victims, Japanese war crimes, population transfers in the Soviet Union, other War Crimes and deaths due to war related famine and disease. Compiling or estimating the numbers of deaths caused during wars and other violent conflicts is a controversial subject. Historians often put forward many different estimates of the numbers killed during World War II. The distinction between military and civilian casualties caused directly by warfare and collateral damage is not always clear cut. For nations that suffered huge losses such as the Soviet Union, China, Poland, Germany and Yugoslavia, our sources can give us only the total estimated population loss caused by the war and a rough estimate of the breakdown of deaths caused by military activity, crimes against humanity and war related famine. The footnotes give a detailed breakdown of the casualties and their sources, including data on the number of wounded where reliable sources are available.
Human losses by country.
USSR.
The estimated breakdown for each Soviet Republic of total war dead is as follows
Holocaust deaths.
Included in the above figures of total war dead are the victims of the Holocaust.
Jewish deaths.
The Holocaust is the term generally used to describe the genocide of approximately six million European Jews during World War II. Martin Gilbert estimates 5.7 million (78%) of the 7.3 million Jews in German occupied Europe were Holocaust victims. Other estimates for Holocaust deaths range between 4.9 to 6.0 million Jews.
The following figures are from "The Columbia Guide to the Holocaust".
Non-Jews persecuted and killed by the Nazis.
Some scholars maintain that the definition of the Holocaust should also include the other victims persecuted and killed by the Nazis.
Estimates of the death toll of non-Jewish victims vary by millions, partly because the boundary between death by persecution and death by starvation and other means in a context of total war is unclear. Donald Niewyk maintains that the Holocaust can be defined in four ways: first, that it was the genocide of the Jews alone; second, that there were several parallel Holocausts, one for each of the several groups; third, the Holocaust would include Roma and the handicapped along with the Jews; fourth, it would include all racially motivated German crimes, such as the murder of Soviet prisoners of war, Polish and Soviet civilians, as well as political prisoners, religious dissenters, and homosexuals. Using this definition, the total number of Holocaust victims is between 11 million and 17 million people. According to the College of Education of the University of South Florida "Approximately 11 million people were killed because of Nazi genocidal policy". R. J. Rummel estimated the death toll due to Nazi Democide at 20.9 million persons. Timothy Snyder put the victims of the Nazis killed only as result of "deliberate policies of mass murder" such as executions, deliberate famine and in death camps at 10.4 million persons including 5.4 million Jews. The German scholar Hellmuth Auerbach puts the death toll in the Hitler era at 6 million Jews killed in the Holocaust and 7 million other victims of the Nazis. Dieter Pohl puts the total number of victims of the Nazi era at between 12 and 14 million persons, including 5.6–5.7 million Jews.
Roma losses by country
Included in the figures of total war dead are the Roma victims of the Nazi persecution, some scholars include the Roma deaths with the Holocaust.
The following figures are from "The Columbia Guide to the Holocaust".
Japanese war crimes.
Included with total war dead are victims of Japanese war crimes.
Repression in the Soviet Union.
The total war dead in the USSR includes victims of Soviet repression. The number of deaths in the Gulag labor camps increased as a result of wartime overcrowding and food shortages. The Stalin regime deported the entire populations of ethnic minorities considered to be potentially disloyal. Since 1990 Russian scholars have been given access to the Soviet-era archives and have published data on the numbers of persons executed and those who died in Gulag labor camps and prisons. The Russian scholar Viktor Zemskov puts the death toll from 1941–1945 at about 1 million based on data from the Soviet archives. The Soviet-era archive figures on the Gulag labor camps has been the subject of a vigorous academic debate outside Russia since their publication in 1991. J. Arch Getty and Stephen G. Wheatcroft maintain that Soviet-era figures more accurately detail the victims of the Gulag labor camp system in the Stalin era. Robert Conquest and Steven Rosefielde have disputed the accuracy of the data from the Soviet archives, maintaining that the demographic data and testimonials by survivors of the Gulag labor camps indicate a higher death toll. Rosefielde believes that the release of the Soviet Archive figures is disinformation generated by the modern KGB. Rosefielde maintains that the data from the Soviet archives is incomplete; for example, he pointed out that the figures do not include the 22,000 victims of the Katyn massacre. Rosefielde's demographic analysis puts the number of excess deaths due to Soviet repression at 2,183,000 in 1939–1940 and 5,458,000 from 1941–1945. Michael Haynes and Rumy Husun accept the figures from the Soviet archives as being an accurate tally of Stalin's victims, they maintain that the demographic data depicts an underdeveloped Soviet economy and the losses in World War Two rather than indicating a higher death toll in the Gulag labor camps.
In August 2009 the Polish Institute of National Remembrance (IPN) researchers estimated 150,000 Polish citizens were killed due to Soviet repression. Since the collapse of the USSR, Polish scholars have been able to do research in the Soviet archives on Polish losses during the Soviet occupation. Andrzej Paczkowski puts the number of Polish deaths at 90,000–100,000 of the 1.0 million persons deported and 30,000 executed by the Soviets. In 2005 Tadeusz Piotrowski estimated the death toll in Soviet hands at 350,000.
The Estonian State Commission on Examination of Policies of Repression put civilian deaths due to the Soviet occupation in 1940–1941 at 33,900 including (7,800 deaths) of arrested people, (6,000) deportee deaths, (5,000) evacuee deaths, (1,100) people gone missing and (14,000) conscripted for forced labor. After the reoccupation by the U.S.S.R., 5,000 Estonians died in Soviet prisons during 1944–45.

Russian sources list Axis prisoner of war deaths of 580,589 in Soviet captivity based on data in the Soviet archives (Germany 381,067; Hungary 54,755; Romania 54,612; Italy 27,683; Finland 403, and Japan 62,069). However some western scholars estimate the total at between 1.7 and 2.3 million.
Commonwealth military casualties.
The Commonwealth War Graves Commission Annual Report 2010-2011 is the source of the military dead for the British Empire The war dead totals listed in the report are based on the research by the CWGC to identify and commemorate Commonwealth war dead. The statistics tabulated The Commonwealth War Graves Commission are representative of the number of names commemorated for all servicemen/women of the Armed Forces of the Commonwealth and former U.K. Dependencies, whose death was attributable to their war service. Some auxiliary and civilian organizations are also accorded war grave status if death occurred under certain specified conditions. For the purposes of C.W.G.C. the dates of inclusion for Commonwealth War Dead are 03/09/1939 to 31/12/1947.

Military war dead reported by Rüdiger Overmans of 260,749 are included with Germany. The Austrian government provides the following information on human losses during the rule of the Nazis. "For Austria the consequences of the Nazi regime and the Second World War were disastrous: During this period 2,700 Austrians had been executed and more than 16,000 citizens murdered in the concentration camps. Some 16,000 Austrians were killed in prison, while over 67,000 Austrian Jews were deported to death camps, only 2,000 of them lived to see the end of the war. In addition, 247,000 Austrians lost their lives serving in the army of the Third Reich or were reported missing, and 24,000 civilians were killed during bombing" raids. These figures include the genocide of Romani people of 6,500 persons and Jewish Holocaust victims totaling 65,000.
Belgian government sources reported that military war dead included 8,800 killed, 500 missing in action, 200 executed, 800 resistance movement fighters and 1,800 POWs.

Regarding partisan and civilian casualties the Russian journalist Vadim Erlikman notes "According to the official data of the royal government 2,320 were killed and 199 executed. The communists claim that 20–35,000 persons died. In reality deaths were 10,000, including and unknown number of civilians." 3,000 civilians were killed by Anglo-American air raids, including 1,374 in Bombing of Sofia in World War II.

Civilian deaths during the Japanese occupation of Burma totaled 250,000; 110,000 Burmese, plus 100,000 Indian and 40,000 Chinese civilians in Burma. Werner Gruhl estimates Burma's dead at 170,000 civilians due to the Japanese occupation.
The Commonwealth War Graves Commission lists 45,383 war dead. is the source of the military dead for the British Empireincluding 102 deaths from Newfoundland with the Canadian forces. The Canadian War Museum puts military losses at 42,000 plus 1,600 Merchant Navy deaths.

Sources for total Chinese war dead range from 10 to 20 million as detailed below.
John W. Dower has noted "So great was the devastation and suffering in China that in the end it is necessary to speak of uncertain 'millions' of deaths. Certainly, it is reasonable to think in general terms of approximately 10 million Chinese war dead, a total surpassed only by the Soviet Union."
The official Chinese government statistics for China's civilian and military casualties in the Second Sino-Japanese War from 1937–1945 are 20 million dead and 15 million wounded.

John W. Dower cites a UN report that estimated 4 million famine and forced labor dead during the Japanese Occupation of Indonesia.
The United Nations reported in 1947 that "about 30,000 Europeans and 300,000 Indonesian internees and forced laborers died during the occupation." They reported, "The total number who were killed by the Japanese, or who died from, hunger, disease and lack of medical attention is estimated at 3,000,000 for Java alone, 1,000,000 for the Outer Islands. Altogether 35,000 of the 240,000 Europeans died; most of them were men of working age."

Sources for total IndoChinese civilian war dead range from 1 to 1.5 million as detailed below.
John W. Dower estimated 1.0 million deaths due to Vietnamese Famine of 1945 during Japanese occupation.
German population
The 1939 Population is for Germany within 1937 borders and Danzig and Memel Territory which were annexed in 1939, not included with the German population are Austria and the 6,700,000 ethnic Germans of Europe. However, the 601,000 military deaths of ethnic Germans from Eastern and Western Europe and 261,000 Austrians are included with total German military losses.
Total German war dead
Sources for total German war deaths, within 1937 borders, range from 5.5 to 6.9 million. In 1956 The German government estimated 5.5 million of deaths directly caused by the war. A German demographic study estimated 6.9 million excess deaths caused by the war, for the population within the 1937 borders. These losses included about 4.4 million military dead and missing; 1.0 million civilian deaths during the war and 1.5 civilians who died as a result of expulsions from Poland and the famine in Germany during 1945–46. There were additional deaths of the ethnic Germans in Eastern Europe. A recent study by Rüdiger Overmans found 538,000 military deaths of ethnic Germans who were conscripted by Germany in Eastern Europe. The number of war related civilian deaths among the ethnic Germans from Eastern European countries is disputed. An analysis by the West German government in 1958 estimated civilian deaths among the ethnic Germans from Eastern Europe countries at 886,000. However, a more recent study by the German government archives estimated c.200,000 civilian deaths directly caused by the war among the ethnic Germans from Eastern European countries.
German military casualties
Rüdiger Overmans, an associate of the German Armed Forces Military History Research Office from 1987 until 2004, has provided an official reassessment of German military war dead based on a statistical survey of German military personnel records. The results of the Overmans research project were published with the endorsement of the German Armed Forces Military History Research Office of the Federal Ministry of Defense (Germany). The study found that the statistics collected by German military during the war were incomplete and did not provide an accurate accounting of casualties. In the mid 1990s when Overmans began the project German military dead in the war were estimated at about 4.3 million men. Since the collapse of communism previously classified documentation regarding German military casualties became available to German researchers. The research by Overmans concluded in 2000 that German military dead and missing were 5,318,000. Included in this total are 344,000 deaths that were previously listed as civilian expulsion losses in eastern Europe; 230,000 deaths of paramilitary, Volkssturm and police forces fighting with the regular forces and the deaths of 266,000 POW after the surrender in May 1945. The figure of 3.2 million German military dead that still appears in many sources was a preliminary estimate made in November 1949 by the West German government for losses only within the borders of 1937 Germany, not including Austria and Volksdeutsche conscripted by Nazi Germany. Overmans did not include an additional 215,000 deaths of Soviet citizens conscripted by Germany.
Military losses by theatre
Overmans lists the following losses: Africa 16,066; the Balkans 103,693; Northern Europe 30,165; Western Europe until 12/31/44 339,957; Italy 150,660; against the U.S.S.R. until 12/31/44 2,742,909; final battles in Germany during 1945 1,230,045; other (including air war in Germany and at sea) 245,561; confirmed deaths of POWs in captivity 459,475.
Military losses by country of origin
Overmans lists deaths of 4,456,000 men from pre-war Germany (1937 borders) and the Free City of Danzig, 261,000 from Austria, 534,000 ethnic Germans conscripted in eastern Europe, 30,000 French (mostly men conscripted in Alsace-Lorraine), and 37,000 volunteers from western Europe.
Military losses by branch of service
Overmans lists losses by branch as: Army 4,202,030; Air Force 432,706; Navy 138,429; Waffen SS 313,749; Volkssturm 77,726; other paramilitary and support forces 153,891.
Military prisoners of war and missing
 The details of these POW deaths by country that held them in custody are as follows: USSR 363,000; France 34,000; USA 22,000; UK 21,000; Yugoslavia 11,000; other nations 8,000. Rüdiger Overmans believes that ""It seems entirely plausible, while not provable, that one half of the 1.5 million missing on the eastern front were killed in action, the other half (700,000) however in fact died in Soviet custody"". A 1995 study by the Russian Academy of Science lists the deaths of 474,967 of the 2,652,672 German Armed Forces POW taken in the War.

The West German government estimated 655,000 civilian deaths during war in Germany and Austria: 500,000 killed by strategic bombing, 135,000 in the 1945 flight and evacuations from East Europe and 20,000 civilians killed during the land campaign in Germany. For Germany within the 1937 borders 465,000 killed by strategic bombing, 127,000 in the 1945 flight and evacuations from East Europe and 20,000 civilians were killed during the land campaign in Germany. A 1990 study by the German historian :de:Olaf Groehler estimated 360,000–370,000 civilians were killed by Allied strategic bombing within the 1937 German boundaries, for the German Reich including Austria, forced laborers, POW and military the total is estimated at 406,000. This revised estimate was published in the authoritative series "The German Reich and the Second World War".

A. In 1950 the West German government made a preliminary estimate of 3.0 million civilian deaths in the expulsions. At the same time German Red Cross began to investigate the cases of persons reported missing in the area of the expulsions. The first attempt to compute the losses was made in 1953 by the German scholar Gotthold Rhode who estimated German military and civilian deaths in East Europe at 3,140,000. The Schieder commission estimated a civilian death toll in the expulsions of about 2.3 million persons, broken out as follows: Poland 2,000,000; Czechoslovakia 225,600; Yugoslavia 69,000; Romania 20,000; Hungary 6,000. These early estimates are no longer considered valid because subsequent investigations provided a revised accounting of the losses.
B. A 1958 West German government demographic study estimated 2,225,000 civilians died during the flight during the war, post war expulsions and the forced labor in the Soviet Union, broken out as follows: Poland 1,607,000; Czechoslovakia 273,000; Yugoslavia 136,000; Romania 101,000; Hungary 57,000; Baltic States 51,000. A figure of about 2 million civilian deaths is often cited in English language sources dealing with the expulsions based on the 1958 German government statistical analysis as well as the report of the Schieder commission. In 1967 the West German government issued a revised figure of 2,111,000 total dead. In 2006 The German government reaffirmed its belief that 2 million civilians perished in the flight and expulsion from Eastern Europe. The German scholar Rüdiger Overmans believes that the statistical foundations of the 1958 West German government demographic report are questionable and cannot be regarded as definitive. A recent analysis by a Polish scholar found that "Generally speaking, the German estimates... are not only highly arbitrary, but also clearly tendentious in presentation of the German losses". He maintains that the German government figures from 1958 overstated the total number of the ethnic Germans living in Poland prior to war as well as the total civilian deaths due to the expulsions.
C. By 1965, the Suchdienst (search service) of the German churches was able to confirm 473,013 civilian deaths in eastern Europe due to the war and expulsions, broken out as follows: Poland 367,392; Sudetenland 18,889; Slovakia, Hungary, Romania and Yugoslavia 64,779; Baltic States 9,064; and Germans resettled in Poland 12,889. There were an additional 1,905,991 unsolved cases of persons reported missing and presumed dead. Rüdiger Overmans gave a summary of this data at a 1994 historical symposium in Poland. Overmans pointed out that the figures are incomplete and only a partial not an exact accounting of total deaths. Overmans believed that since there were only about 500,000 confirmed deaths of German civilians in eastern Europe, the balance being a demographic estimate, that new research on the number of expulsion deaths was needed. However, the German historian Ingo Harr believes that the Church Service figure of 473,000 confirmed deaths is a realistic view of the total deaths due to the flight during the war and expulsions.
D. A 1974 study by the German government archives estimated a death toll of about 600,000 of civilians who died as a result of what they call "crimes against international law". Their definition of crimes includes deaths caused by military activity in the 1944–45 campaign as well as deliberate killings. The total of 600,000 is broken out as follows: Poland c. 400,000(120,000 killed by Soviet forces and their Allies; 200,000 dead during the forced labor of Germans in the Soviet Union; 60,000 dead in Polish internment and labor camps and 40,000 in Soviet camps in the Kaliningrad Oblast); Czechoslovakia 30,000 killed by Soviet forces and their Allies, and an estimated 100,000 in internment camps; Yugoslavia c. 80,000(killed by Soviet forces and their Allies 15–20,000; dead during the forced labor of Germans in the Soviet Union 4,500; dead in internment camps c. 60,000). This report did not provide an estimate for ethnic German deaths in Romania and Hungary. Rüdiger Overmans believes that the 1974 report is only a partial not a definitive accounting of total deaths in the expulsions. However, the German historian Ingo Harr believes the Archives study has provided a more realistic view of the total deaths due to the expulsions.
E. A revised demographic analysis published in 1995, which has the support of the German government, estimated 2,020,000 civilians died during the post war expulsions and the forced labor of Germans in the Soviet Union broken out as follows: Poland 1,192,000; Czechoslovakia 220,000; Yugoslavia 106,000; Romania 75,000; Hungary 84,000; Baltic States 33,000; USSR 310,000. The German government maintains that the figure of about 2 million deaths is correct because it includes additional post war deaths from hunger and disease of those civilians subject to the expulsions.
F. In 1996 a joint Czech–German Historical Commission determined that between 15,000 and 30,000 Germans perished in the expulsions. The commission found that the demographic estimates by the German government of 220,000 to 270,000 civilian deaths due to expulsions from Czechoslovakia were based on faulty data. The Commission determined that the demographic estimates by the German government counted as missing 90,000 ethnic Germans assimilated into the Czech population; military deaths were understated and that the 1950 census data used to compute the demographic losses was unreliable.
G. Research by former ethnic Germans from Yugoslavia determined that 58,730 civilians perished after the war, broken out as follows: killed by partisans 8,049; dead during the forced labor of Germans in the Soviet Union 1,994; dead in internment camps 48,687.
H. In his 2000 study of German military casualties Rüdiger Overmans found 344,000 additional military deaths of Germans from the former eastern territories of Germany and conscripted ethnic Germans from Eastern Europe. Overmans believes this will reduce the number of civilians previously listed as missing in the expulsions.
I. The Polish historian Bernadetta Nitschke has provided a summary of the research in Poland on the calculation of German losses due to the flight and resettlement of the Germans from Poland only, not including other eastern European countries. Nitschke contrasted the estimate of 1.6 million deaths in Poland reported in 1958 by the West German government with the more recent figure of 400,000 that was detailed by Rűdiger Overmans in 1994. She noted that the Polish researcher Stefan Banasiak estimated in 1963 that the death toll in the post deportations was 1,136 persons, a figure accepted by other Polish historians who maintain that most of the deaths occurred during the flight and evacuation during the war, the deportation to the U.S.S.R. for forced labor, and after the resettlement due to the harsh conditions in the Soviet occupation zone in post war Germany. This is in sharp contrast to the West German Schieder commission report which maintained that 1.7 million civilian deaths occurred after the war on Polish territory.
J. In 2006 The German government reaffirmed its belief that 2 million civilians perished in the flight and expulsion from Eastern Europe. They maintain that the figure is correct because it includes additional post war deaths from malnutrition and disease of those civilians subject to the expulsions State Secretary in the German Federal Ministry of the Interior, Christoph Bergner, outlined the stance of the respective governmental institutions in Deutschlandfunk saying that the numbers presented by the German government and others are not contradictory to the numbers cited by Haar, and that the below 600,000 estimate comprises the deaths directly caused by atrocities during the expulsion measures and thus only includes people who on the spot were raped, beaten, or else brought to death, while the above two millions estimate also includes people who on their way to post-war Germany have died of epidemics, hunger, cold, air raids and the like.
K. In 2005 the German Red Cross Search Service still maintained that their research put losses at 2,252,500 persons in the expulsions and deportations. They did not provide details of the figure.
Famine deaths 1945–1946
The German economist Bruno Gleitze from the German Institute for Economic Research estimated that there were 1,200,000 deaths caused by an increase in mortality due to harsh conditions in Germany during and after the war. In Allied-occupied Germany the shortage of food was an acute problem in 1946–47. The average kilocalorie intake per day was only 1,600 to 1,800, an amount insufficient for long-term health.
Gregory Frumkin, who was throughout its existence editor of the "Statistical Year-Book of the League of Nations" gave the following assessment of Greek losses in the war. He points out that that ""the data on Greek war losses are frequently divergent and even inconsistent"." His estimates for Greek losses are as follows: the war dead included 20,000 military deaths in the Greco-Italian War of 1940–41, 60,000 non-Jewish civilians, 20,000 non-Jewish deportees, 60,000 Jews and 140,000 famine deaths during the Axis occupation of Greece during World War II.
The Greek National Council for Reparations from Germany reports the following casualties during the Axis occupation of Greece during World War II. Military dead 35,077, including: 13,327 killed in the Greco-Italian War of 1940–41; 1,100 with the Greek Forces in the Mid-East, and 20,650 partisan deaths. Civilian deaths 771,845, including: 56,225 executed by Axis forces; 105,000 dead in German concentration camps (including Jews); 7,120 deaths due to bombing; 3,500 merchant marine dead; and 600,000 war-related famine deaths.

Tamás Stark of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences has provided the following assessment of Hungarian losses. Total losses were 750,000 in the Greater Hungary; 350,000 Military dead including 110–120,000 killed in action, 20–25,000 Jews in Hungarian military labor camps and 200,000 in Soviet POW and labor camps. Civilian dead included 340,000 Hungarian Jews and 50,000 deaths attributed to military actions and the persecution of national minorities. However only 64% of these losses(480,000) were within the 1939 borders of Hungary, military killed were 80,000 and 130,000 in Soviet POW and labor camps, Jewish Holocaust dead were 220,000 and civilian war dead 44,000. Hungarian military losses include 110,000men who were conscripted from the annexed territories of Greater Hungary in Slovakia, Romania and Yugoslavia and the deaths of 20,000–25,000 Jews conscripted for Army labor units. Civilian losses were 44,500 killed in the 1944–45 military campaign and in air attacks. Russian sources give the deaths of 54,700 of the 513,700 Hungarian POW taken in the War. The genocide of Roma people of 28,000 persons. Jewish Holocaust victims within the 1939 borders were 200,000.

Losses during allied occupation in 1941.
Losses during Anglo-Iraqi War and UK occupation in 1941.
Despite being neutral, Ireland suffered casualties serving in the UK Armed Forces. Between 1939–1945 an estimated 70,000 citizens of neutral Ireland served in the British armed forces, together with 50,000 or so from Northern Ireland. In April 1995 Taoiseach John Bruton spoke at Islandbridge and paid tribute to the 150,000 Irish people North and South who "volunteered to fight against Nazi tyranny in Europe, at least 10,000 of whom were killed while serving in British uniforms ... In recalling their bravery, we are recalling a shared experience of Irish and British people ... We remember a British part of the inheritance of all who live in Ireland". The civilian death figure includes 33 Irish merchantmen were killed when a U-Boat torpedoed the SS Irish Pine (1919) and deaths caused by the presumably accidental bombing of Ireland in three instances.

There were in addition to these losses the deaths of African soldiers conscripted by Italy which were estimated by the Italian military at 10,000 in East African Campaign of 1940–41. Civilian losses as a result of the fighting in Italian Libya were estimated by an independent Russian journalist to be 10,000.
 Russian sources list the deaths of 28,000 of the 49,000 Italian war prisoners in Soviet Union 1942-1954. Military losses in Italy after the September 1943 Armistice with Italy, included 5,927 with the Allies, 17,488 Italian resistance movement fighters and 13,000 RSI Italian Social Republic Fascist forces. The genocide of Roma people was 1,000 persons. Jewish Holocaust victims totaled 8,562 (including Libya).
1939 Japanese population includes 1.7 million Japanese in China and Korea.
Japanese military losses were 2,120,000 including 1,740,000 in the war from 1937 to 1945 and 380,000 POW deaths after the surrender. John W. Dower reported that Japanese government figures list the military deaths of 1,740,955 during 1937–45. The details are as follows: 185,647 in China from 1937 to 1941, and 1,555,308 from 1941 to 1945 in the Pacific War. Army: against US 485,717; against UK/Netherlands 208,026; in China 202,958; against Australia 199,511; French Indochina 2,803; against USSR 7,483; other overseas 23,388; Japan proper 10,543. Navy: 1941–45 414,879. "Only one third of the military deaths occurred in actual combat, the majority being caused by illness and starvation." In addition there were the deaths of prisoners after the surrender. According to John W. Dower, the "known deaths of Japanese troops awaiting repatriation in Allied (non-Soviet) hands were listed as 81,090 by U.S. authorities". An additional 300,000 Japanese prisoners died in Soviet hands after the surrender in Manchuria, Korea and the USSR." The Japanese Ministry of Welfare and Foreign Office reported that 347,000 military personnel and civilians were dead or missing in Soviet hands after the war. The Japanese list the losses of 199,000 in Manchurian transit camps, 36,000 in North Korea, 9,000 from Sakhalin and 103,000 in the USSR. These figures were disputed by the Soviet Union, Russian sources report the POW deaths of 62,105(61,855 Japanese and 214 collaborator forces) out of the 640,105 captured(609,448 Japanese and 30,657 collaborator forces).
Military deaths include Koreans and Chinese from Taiwan conscripted by Japan. Not included in Japanese war dead are 432,000 Chinese military forces collaborating with Japan.
Estimates for Japanese civilian losses range from 500,000, to 1,000,000 dead. The lower figure of 500,000 includes those deaths during the war caused by allied bombing and the fighting on Okinawa. The higher estimate of 1,000,000 includes additional post war deaths of persons injured in the Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki and excess deaths due to adverse post war conditions. In Allied occupied Japan the shortage of food was an acute problem, in 1946 the average kilocalorie intake per day was only 1,530 compared to the average of 1,950 during the war years, this was an amount insufficient for long-term health. The General Headquarters for the Allied Powers in Tokyo reported the civilian death rate in Japan in the first year after the war to be 2.1% compared to the pre-war level of 1.6%.
John W. Dower reports civilian losses due to U.S. strategic bombing according to official Japanese figures were 393,367 dead, including 210,000 killed in the Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki and 97,031 in the Bombing of Tokyo in World War II. In addition to these deaths 150,000 civilians were killed on Okinawa and 10,000 on Saipan during the fighting. The Japanese government reported that 60,000 civilians dead or missing in Soviet hands after the war. War related deaths of Japanese merchant marine personnel were 27,000. The US Strategic bombing survey estimated 252,769 killed Japanese in the air war. They also estimated the death toll in Hiroshima and Nagasaki at 105,000 to 115,000.

The classification of ethnic groups in pre-war Poland by language spoken is disputed. The Polish demographer Piotr Eberhardt maintains that it is commonly agreed that the criterion of declared language led to an overestimation of the number of Poles in pre-war Poland. He notes that in general, the numbers declaring a particular language do not mesh with the numbers declaring the corresponding nationality. Members of ethnic minority groups believe that the language criterion led to an overestimation of Poles.
Czesław Łuczak estimated in 1994 the actual total of war dead to be 5.9 to 6.0 million, including 2.9 to 3.0 million Jews. He estimated the number of ethnic Poles who died at 2.0 million, including 1.5 million, due to the German occupation of the territory of modern day Poland and the balance of 500,000 in the former eastern Polish regions under both Soviet and German occupation. Łuczak also included in his figures an estimated 1,000,000 war dead of Polish citizens from the ethnic Ukrainian and Belarusian ethnic groups who comprised 20% of Poland's pre-war population. The Polish government estimate made in 1947 of 6.0 million war dead excluded ethnic Ukrainian and Belarusian losses.

Warsaw 1947.(the figures of 2.8 miilion Jews and 3.2 miilion Poles are based on language spoken, not religion)</ref> The figure of 6.0 million war dead has been disputed by Polish scholars since the fall of communism who now put the total actual losses at about 3.0 million Jews and 2.0 million ethnic Poles, not including other ethnic groups (Ukrainians and Belarussians). They maintain that the official statistics include those persons who were missing and presumed dead, but actually remained abroad in the west and the USSR after the war. The United States Holocaust Memorial Museum maintains that in addition to 3 million Polish Jews killed in the Holocaust. "Documentation remains fragmentary, but today scholars of independent Poland believe that 1.8 to 1.9 million Polish civilians (non-Jews) were victims of German Occupation policies and the war."

Polish losses during the Soviet occupation (1939–1941)
In August 2009 the Polish Institute of National Remembrance (IPN) researchers estimated 150,000 Polish citizens were killed due to Soviet repression. Since the collapse of the USSR, Polish scholars have been able to do research in the Soviet archives on Polish losses during the Soviet occupation. Andrzej Paczkowski puts the number of Polish deaths at 90,000–100,000 of the 1.0 million persons deported and 30,000 executed by the Soviets. In 2005 Tadeusz Piotrowski estimated the death toll in Soviet hands at 350,000. An earlier estimate made in 1987 by Franciszek Proch of the Polish Association of Former Political Prisoners of Nazi and Soviet Concentration Camps estimated the total dead due to the Soviet occupation at 1,050,000.
Polish military casualties
Poland lost a total of 139,800 regular soldiers and 100,000 Polish resistance movement fighters during the war. Polish military casualties.

 Richard Overy has noted that "The official figures themselves must be viewed critically, given the difficulty of knowing in the chaos of 1941 and 1942 exactly who had been killed, wounded or even conscripted". The official Russian statistics for military dead do not include an additional estimated 500,000 conscripted reservists missing or killed before being listed on active strength, 1,000,000 civilians treated as POW by Germany; and an estimated 150,000 militia and 250,000 Soviet partisan dead, which are considered civilian war losses in the official figures. The estimate by most western historians of Soviet military POW deaths is about 3 million out of 5.7 million total POWs in German hands.

</ref> published a critical analysis of the official Russian wartime casualty statistics, he estimated actual Soviet military war dead at more than 10.9 million persons. He maintained that the official figures cannot be reconciled to the total men drafted and that POW deaths were understated. Mikhalev believed that the official figure of 26.6 million war dead should not be regarded as definitive. His analysis of the demographic balance of the USSR in the war indicated total losses ranging from 21.240 million to 25.854 million, with the mid range being 23.568 million total war dead. Mikhalev pointed out that the estimate of total war deaths are based on a range of estimates for the population in 1939 and the population of the annexed territories that are by no means certain.

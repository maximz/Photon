Kenneth Bernard Faried Lewis (born November 19, 1989), nicknamed the "Manimal", is an American professional basketball player who currently plays for the Denver Nuggets of the National Basketball Association (NBA). He was a center at Morehead State University, where he was named Ohio Valley Conference Player of the Year and an All-American in 2010.
High school career.
Faried attended Technology High School in Newark, New Jersey. He received recruiting interest from Marist and Iona colleges in New York, but chose to attend Morehead State University in Morehead, Kentucky.
College career.
Faried, a 6'8 (2.03 m) post player, came to Morehead State in 2007 and became one of the best players in school and conference history. Faried led the Ohio Valley Conference in rebounding as both a sophomore and a junior (13.0 rebounds per game in each season) – ranking him third in the NCAA in 2008–09 and second in 2009–10. Faried also chipped in double-digit scoring in each of his three varsity seasons.
Faried also led the Eagles to team success, as Morehead claimed a berth in the 2009 NCAA tournament by winning the Ohio Valley conference tournament. Faried led the way, scoring 15 points and grabbing 17 rebounds in the final against Austin Peay, and was named tournament Most Valuable Player. In his junior year, Faried again led the Eagles to the post-season as they advanced to the second round of the College Basketball Invitational. At the end of the season, Faried was named OVC player and defensive player of the year and an AP honorable mention All-American. He also passed 1000 rebounds for his career.
After his junior season, Faried declared himself eligible for the 2010 NBA Draft. However, he elected to return for his senior season, pulling out on May 7, 2010.
Faried broke Tim Duncan's modern-era (post-1973) Division I career rebounding mark of 1,570 rebounds (which had stood since 1997) with 12 rebounds in the Eagles' 71–65 victory over Indiana State on February 19, 2011. Morehead State again won the Ohio Valley conference tournament, earning a 13 seed in the 2011 NCAA tournament. Led by the play of Faried, Morehead State pulled off a huge upset in the first round of the tournament, upsetting the 4 seed Louisville Cardinals. Faried ended his collegiate career with 1,673 rebounds.
In his senior season, Faried was named a second-team All-American by the United States Basketball Writers Association and by Fox Sports.
On April 1, 2011, Faried was named the most valuable player of the Reese's college all-star game.
On June 23, 2011, Faried was selected 22nd overall in the 2011 NBA Draft by the Nuggets.
Professional career.
Denver Nuggets (2011–present).
In the beginning of his time with the Nuggets, he acclimated to being an NBA player, but got little playing time behind Nenê. After multiple Nuggets players got injured including Nenê, he started to pick up playing time later in the season. Faried's style of playing impressed team managers and coaches of the Nuggets organization. On March 15, 2012, Nenê was traded to the Washington Wizards. This deal was made in part because of Faried's outstanding performance over the previous few weeks. Since then, Faried has been the Nuggets' starting power forward. In his first game after the trade of Nenê, Faried had 18 points and a career high 16 rebounds. However, he surpassed both those marks when he had career highs in points and rebounds, with 27 and 17, respectively, on April 9, 2012. His physical style of play earned him the nickname "Manimal." He finished 3rd in NBA Rookie of the Year voting for the 2011-12 NBA season. 
In the second week of the 2012-13 NBA season, Faried won the Player of the Week award due to his aggressive playing style and offensive rebounds. On November 15, 2012, Faried set a new career high with 20 rebounds in a game against the Miami Heat.
Faried was the MVP of the 2013 BBVA Rising Stars Challenge where he recorded a double-double with 40 points on 18-for-22 shooting and 10 rebounds.

Gisele Caroline Bündchen (, ; born 20 July 1980) is a Brazilian fashion model and occasional film actress and producer. She is the goodwill ambassador for the United Nations Environment Programme. In the late 1990s, Bündchen became the first in a wave of Brazilian models to find international success. In 1999, "Vogue" dubbed her "The Return of the Sexy Model", and she was credited with ending the "heroin chic" era of modeling. Bündchen was one of Victoria's Secret Angels from 2000 until mid-2007. Since 2004, she has been the highest-paid model in the world, and is the sixteenth richest woman in the entertainment industry (as of 2007) with an estimated $250 million fortune.

Family and early life.
Bündchen is a sixth-generation German Brazilian, born in Três de Maio, Rio Grande do Sul, to Vânia Nonnenmacher, a bank clerk pensioner, and Valdir Bündchen, a university teacher and writer who are both of German descent. Bündchen was born and raised in Horizontina, a southern region in Brazil where there is a large population of German ancestry. She grew up with her five sisters—Raquel, Graziela, Gabriela, Rafaela, and her fraternal twin Patrícia, her junior by five minutes. She speaks Portuguese as her native language, in addition to Spanish and English. She studied German in school.
In 1993, Bündchen joined a modeling course with her sisters Patrícia and Gabriela at their mother's insistence. The following year, Bündchen was discovered by the Elite modeling agency at a shopping mall in São Paulo while on a school excursion. She was subsequently selected for a national contest, Elite Look of the Year, in which she placed second. Claudia Menezes from Bahia took first place. Bündchen placed fourth in the Elite Model Look world contest, held in Ibiza, Spain. She then moved to São Paulo to launch her modeling career. In 1996 Bündchen had her first New York City break at Fashion Week.

Public image.
24 September 2000, "Newsweek" published an article "This Year's Model" which emphasized a craze in modeling culture in Brazil because of Gisele. "In Brazil, where beauty is as highly valued as futebol or the samba, modeling has become an obsession. Modeling courses, makeup workshops and beauty contests are all the rage. Crash diets are in vogue. A dozen big-name modeling agencies like Marilyn have set up shop in São Paulo and deployed an army of talent scouts to beat the pavement for new faces. And from the smallest parish in the southern grain belt to the swank boulevards of Sao Paulo, kids are practicing their posture and perfecting their pouts. Capricho, a glossy teen magazine, recently asked 1,100 Brazilian teenagers if they wanted to become fashion models. Eighty-six percent said yes.
The reason for this craze stands 1.77 meters tall and has smoldering blue eyes. Her name is Gisele Bundchen--known to all as Gisele--and she is the most celebrated Brazilian since Pele." it stated. they went onto claim; "It would be difficult to overstate Gisele's impact, not only on Brazil but on the modeling industry as well. Just two years ago the celebrity model looked like an endangered species. The public grew so weary of the pampered princesses that they were pushed off magazine and tabloid covers by pop singers, movie stars, even politicians. Then came Gisele. "She had breasts and hips and great hair," says James Scully, booking editor of Harper's Bazaar. "Men want her. Women want to be her. We haven't had that since Cindy and Naomi." And so the fashionistas swarmed to Brazil for Gisele clones. Fashion Pygmalions are scouring the hinterlands for beauties in the rough. Models with nondescript accents are pretending to be Brazilian. "Everyone asks me if I know her," says Brazilian clothing designer Alexandre Herchcovitch, whose popular label, Zoomp, is selling even better in the age of Gisele. Other Brazilian companies are capitalizing on the babe from Brazil as well. When the giant beverage company Ambev wanted to add some oomph to its New York Stock Exchange debut last week, they called Gisele—not Greenspan—who tossed Ambev caps and blew kisses. Says Herchcovitch: "It's a good time to be Brazilian." To be sure, Brazil's modeling business has changed dramatically since Gisele was a schoolgirl. In the mid-'90s, there were five agencies nationwide. Now there are 11, with branches all over the country and a legion of aggressive scouts."
In 2000, Bündchen was dubbed the "Boobs from Brazil" for inspiring the 36,000 breast enhancement surgeries performed that year in Brazil.
In 2006, "Elle" magazine surveyed the American leading stylists and asked them to name the star whose hair was a favourite for their clients. More than 50 percent gave Bündchen the title of "best hair in Hollywood". In February 2008 a survey by the International Society of Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (ISAPS) asked the question, "What influences do celebrities have on the decisions patients make?". The survey was sent to more than 20,000 plastic surgeons in 84 countries. Bündchen was among the most frequently mentioned celebrities. Bündchen won the "abdomen" and "hair" categories and took second place in the "breasts" category.
2008 saw a black-and-white photo of Bündchen, shot by Irving Penn, auctioned for $193,000 (£96,000) alongside images of other models and celebrities, including Carla Bruni. Gisele's fetched by far the most on the night.
She was voted second place on Vanity Fair's world's most beautiful poll in 2009.
In 2010, Bündchen told "Harper's Bazaar" that breastfeeding should be a "worldwide law", but later moderated her comments on her blog, stating: "My intention to make a comment about the importance of breastfeeding".
On January 2011, Bündchen came in first in the "most desired female body" on the "14th Annual Famed Hottest Looks" survey, compiled by Beverly Hills plastic surgeons Dr. Richard Fleming and Dr. Toby Mayer. Even after giving birth in December 2009, her body was the most requested by the doctors' patients. "Different body types are represented on the list because most women are shaped differently and want to look naturally beautiful," explained Dr. Fleming. "Some women want the lean look like Gisele [...]."
In 2011, AskMen.com revealed their annual "Most Desirable Women" list. Bündchen, along with Angelina Jolie and Beyoncé Knowles, are the only women to have made the list every year for ten years in a row. singer Beyonce in a 2011 Harper's Bazaar interview named Gisele as one of her fashion inspiration stating that "I always admire Victoria Beckham and Gisele [Bündchen]. Their style is modern but always classic."
A designer the Tibi Spring/Summer 2012 fashion show at New York Fashion week in fall 2011 explained, "The inspiration is taken heavily from the '90s—a freshly scrubbed Gisele from the pages of Vogue—clean, crisp, sporty looks and relaxed styles you want to live in."
"Vogue" editor Anna Wintour calleded her the "model of the millennium," and the magazine called her "The return of the sexy model". "Rolling Stone" declared her "The Most Beautiful Girl in the World" in 2000 and "Vanity Fair" published an article titled "... And God Created Gisele" in 2009. Bündchen pioneered the "horse walk", a stomping movement created when a model picks her knees up high and kicks her feet out in front. In 2012 The 26th edition of Casa Cor in Brazil, one of the world´s biggest decorating, landscaping, and architecture events, paid tribute to Gisele with a wood sculpture in her image.
After Super Bowl XLVI and the heckling of several Giants fans, Bündchen was caught on video saying, in private conversation, "My husband cannot fucking throw the ball and catch the ball at the same time!" The comment, which was widely publicized both in the traditional media and the blogosphere, caused a media stir.
She was ranked #9 on Men's Health Magazine's list of The Hottest Women of 2013.
In 2013 GQ Magazine listed her among The 100 Hottest Women of the 21st Century.

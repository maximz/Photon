Writing.
Rodriguez is currently working on two screenplays.

Personal life.
A DNA test of Rodriguez, performed by the television program ""Finding Your Roots"", on PBS, stated that her ancestry is 75% European, 23% African, and 2% Native American. She also stated on the program that there was some racial conflict between her families since her Puerto Rican father, Rafael, was light skinned and her Dominican mother, Carmen, had a dark complexion.
Relationships.
In early 2000, Rodriguez broke off a near engagement to a Muslim boyfriend, citing opposition to religious requests he asked of her. 
She has since dated or reportedly been linked with her "Fast and the Furious" co-star Vin Diesel, and SWAT co-star Olivier Martinez. 
In July 2006, Rodriguez told UK's "Cosmopolitan" magazine that she was not lesbian, but had "experimented with both sexes." In November 2006, her openly bisexual "Bloodrayne" co-star Kristanna Loken's comments to "The Advocate" were widely interpreted and reported by the media as an admission that the two were in a relationship, though the relationship was never officially confirmed by either actress. 
In June 2007, the lesbian magazine "Curve" ran a cover story that claimed Rodriguez to be bisexual. Rodriguez criticized the magazine for this, asserting that the magazine "put words in (her) mouth". She again stated that she was not a lesbian in a November 2008 interview in the Dominican women's magazine "Cayena".
Legal issues.
In March 2002, Rodriguez was arrested for assault after getting into a fight with her roommate. The charges were later dropped after the roommate declined to press the allegations in court.
In November 2003, Rodriguez went to court to face eight misdemeanor charges based on two driving incidents including a hit and run and DUI. In June 2004, Rodriguez pleaded no contest in Los Angeles to three of the charges: hit and run, drunken driving, and driving with a suspended license. She went to jail for 48 hours, performed community service at the morgues of two New York hospitals, completed a three-month alcohol program, and was placed on probation for three years.
In 2005, while filming "Lost" in Hawaii, Rodriguez was pulled over by Honolulu police multiple times; she was cited for driving at in a zone on Oahu on November 1, and was fined $357, paid a $300 fine for driving in a zone on October 20, was fined $197 for going in a zone on August 24. 
On December 1, 2005, Rodriguez was pulled over and arrested for driving under the influence. Rodriguez pleaded not guilty when arraigned, but on the day of her trial in April 2006, she pleaded guilty to one charge of driving under the
influence. She chose to pay a $500 fine and spend five days in jail instead of doing 240 hours of community service. Rodriguez
cited her high doses of allergy-relieving steroids as part of the reason for her erratic behavior. Because the Kailua incident was a violation of her Los Angeles probation, Rodriguez was sentenced to 60 days in jail, a 30 day alcohol rehabilitation program and another 30 days of community service, including work for Mothers Against Drunk Driving, by a judge in Los Angeles on May 1, 2006. Because of overcrowding, she was released from jail on the same day she entered. She wrote about the experience on her blog.
In September 2007, Rodriguez allegedly violated her probation by not completing her community service and not following an alcohol education program. It was reported that Rodriguez originally submitted a document stating she performed community service on September 5, 2006, but it was later confirmed she was actually in New York City that day. Her lawyer claimed it was a clerical error. On October 10, 2007, following a hearing, she was sentenced to 180 days jail time after agreeing to admit to violating her probation. She was expected to spend the full 180-day term in jail, as she had been deemed ineligible for work furloughs and house arrest. However, after turning herself in to begin the jail term at the Century Regional Detention Facility located in Lynwood, California on December 23, 2007, Rodriguez was released eighteen days later on January 9, 2008 due to overcrowding.

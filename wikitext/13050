Thomas William "Tom" Selleck (born January 29, 1945) is an American actor and film producer. He is best known for his starring role as the private investigator Thomas Magnum in the television series "Magnum, P.I." (1980 to 1988), based in Hawaii. He also plays Police Chief Jesse Stone in a series of made-for-TV movies based on Robert B. Parker novels. Since 2010, he has appeared as NYPD Police Commissioner Frank Reagan in the drama "Blue Bloods" on CBS-TV.
Selleck has appeared in more than fifty film and television roles since his initial success with "Magnum, P.I.", including a co-starring role in the highest-grossing movie of 1987, "Three Men and a Baby"; "Quigley Down Under"; "Mr. Baseball"; and "Lassiter", to name a few. Selleck has also appeared as Dr. Richard Burke on "Friends", where he played the on-again, off-again love-interest of Monica Geller (Courteney Cox), and A.J. Cooper on "Las Vegas".
Early life.
Selleck was born in Detroit, Michigan, the son of Martha S. (née Jagger), a housewife, and Robert Dean Selleck (died 2001), an executive and real estate investor. The family moved to Sherman Oaks, California, during Selleck's childhood. Tom's siblings include brother Robert (born 1944), brother Daniel (born 1950), and sister Martha. Selleck graduated from Grant High School, in 1962.
Along with modeling, Selleck attended the University of Southern California on a basketball scholarship where he played for the USC Trojans men's basketball team. He is a member of Sigma Chi fraternity and a member of the Trojan Knights. While he majored in business administration, a drama coach suggested Selleck try acting. He then studied acting at the Beverly Hills Playhouse, under Milton Katselas.
Selleck served as a soldier in the 160th Infantry Regiment of the California Army National Guard and his unit was activated for the Watts Riots in Los Angeles.
Career.
Early work and "Magnum P.I.".
Selleck's first TV appearance was as a college senior on "The Dating Game" in 1965, and again in 1967. Soon after, he appeared in commercials for products such as Pepsi-Cola.
He began his career with bit parts in smaller movies, including "Myra Breckinridge" and "The Seven Minutes". He also appeared in number of TV series, mini-series and TV movies. Selleck also had a recurring role in the 1970s as "too good to be true" private investigator Lance White in "The Rockford Files". Lance was very trusting and always lucky, much to the annoyance of Jim Rockford, the show's star private eye played by James Garner. White would frequently say to Rockford, "Don't worry Jim, clues will turn up" and then a clue would just turn up, much to Rockford's consternation, for whom obtaining clues required hard work and hard knocks. Selleck's character was based on one played in Garner's earlier TV series "Maverick" (1957) by Wayde Preston in that series' highest-rated episode, "The Saga of Waco Williams".
Selleck, an accessible but relatively untested actor, spent years receiving little interest from the entertainment industry. His big break came when he was cast in the lead role as Thomas Magnum in "Magnum, P.I.". The "Magnum, P.I." producers would not release the actor for other projects, and, thus, Selleck had to pass on the equally enticing film project for the title role of Indiana Jones, which then went to rising star Harrison Ford. The career-influencing choice between the role of Indiana Jones vs. Magnum P.I. actually haunted Selleck so much that before making the decision, he consulted his best friend on what to do. Together they came to the conclusion that taking the high road and honoring the first contract with Universal Studios was the career-savvy direction. It turned out that the shooting of the pilot for "Magnum" was delayed for over six months (due to a writers' strike) which would have enabled him to complete the role as Indiana Jones, if he had had the option to do so.
Film.
Selleck starred in the 1979 TV movie "Concrete Cowboys" with Jerry Reed. He starred in a number of film roles during and after "Magnum"; among the most notable were as an acrophobic police detective in "Runaway"; as a stand-in father in "Three Men and a Baby"; and as an American 19th century sharpshooter in the Australian western "Quigley Down Under" – a role and film that he considers one of his best. His other films include "Three Men and a Little Lady"; "High Road to China"; "Lassiter"; "Coma"; "Her Alibi"; "An Innocent Man"; "Folks!"; ""; "Mr. Baseball"; "In & Out" and "The Love Letter".
In the early 1990s, Selleck held a press conference to say that he was not gay after a Queer Nation poster allegedly tried to out him. He also sued a tabloid for printing a story that he was gay, a suit which later was settled with an apology and a financial sum that Selleck donated to the University of Southern California journalism program to promote ethics in media. He insisted that he was not anti-gay, however, saying "I would have had the same problem, felt the same kind of righteous indignation, if somebody had said I was having an affair with some actress I had never met," and would later portray an openly gay character in "In & Out" with Kevin Kline.
Selleck is an avid outdoorsman, and a marksman and knowledgeable firearms collector. These interests led him to leading-man cowboy roles in Western films, starting with his role as cowboy and frontier marshal Orrin Sackett in the 1979 film "The Sacketts", opposite Sam Elliott, Jeff Osterhage, and Western legends Glenn Ford and Ben Johnson. He followed "The Sacketts" with "The Shadow Riders" in 1982, then portraying a cat burglar in 1930s London in "Lassiter" in 1984. "Quigley Down Under" is probably one of his best known Western films, however he also won a "Western Heritage Award" for his 1997 role in "Last Stand at Sabre River". His last two cowboy roles to date were in the 2001 TNT movie "Crossfire Trail" (based on a Louis L'Amour novel of the same name), and the 2003 motion picture "Monte Walsh".
He most recently appeared in the film "Killers", along with Katherine Heigl and Ashton Kutcher.
Television.
"Magnum P.I.".
Selleck played the role of Thomas Magnum in 1980 after six failed TV pilots. Magnum was a former U.S. Navy Officer, a veteran of a special operations unit in the Vietnam War, who had resigned his commission with the USN Office of Naval Intelligence ONI, and became a private investigator living in Hawaii. The show would go on for eight seasons and 162 episodes until 1988, winning him an "Emmy Award" for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series in 1984. Selleck was famous for his mustache, a Hawaiian-style aloha shirt, a Detroit Tigers baseball cap, and the Colt Model 1911A1 .45 ACP Caliber pistol his character carried. Magnum drove a Ferrari 308GTSi in the series. The model became so identified with the role that Ferrari fans now refer to the red-painted model as a "Magnum" Ferrari.
Selleck has confirmed that he is the most popular choice by fans to play the role of Magnum in the rumoured upcoming "Magnum P.I." movie.
"Friends".
Throughout the late nineties, Selleck played the role of Richard Burke, Monica's boyfriend, in the hugely successful TV series Friends. Richard was a physician (ophthalmologist) who was a friend of Monica's parents, and at first the relationship was hidden from her parents. The relationship eventually ended over Richard's reluctance to commit to raising a family, though Selleck did make a few extra appearances in later shows.
"The Closer".
In February 1998, Selleck accepted the lead role in a sitcom for CBS called "The Closer". In it he played Jack McLaren, a legendary publicist heading up a brand new marketing firm. His costars included Ed Asner, David Krumholtz, and Penelope Ann Miller. Despite the high pedigree, and the expectations for his first series since "Magnum, P. I.", low ratings caused the show to be canceled after ten episodes.
Jesse Stone series.
Since 2005, Selleck has starred in the role of transplanted lawman Jesse Stone in a series of made-for-TV movies based on Robert B. Parker's novels. To date, the series comprises eight films, with the most recent released on May 20, 2012. In addition to his portrayal of the films' protagonist, Selleck now also acts as producer for the series. The fifth film, "Jesse Stone: Thin Ice", was not adapted from Parker's novels, but rather an original story by Selleck.
"Las Vegas".
He joined the cast of the NBC drama "Las Vegas" in the season-five premiere on September 28, 2007. He played A.J. Cooper, the new owner of the Montecito Casino. He replaced James Caan who left the cast in the same episode. This was Selleck's first regular role on a drama show since he played Thomas Magnum on "Magnum, P.I.".
"Blue Bloods".
"Blue Bloods" is an American police procedural/drama series on CBS, filmed on location in New York City. Frank Reagan (Selleck) is the Police Commissioner; the series follows the Reagan family of police officers with the New York City Police Department. The show premiered on September 24, 2010.
Other work.
Selleck has also appeared in a number of made-for-TV movies in recent years. In particular, he has sought to help bring back to popularity the western, often playing one of that genre's typical characters but thrust into a modern context.
Selleck was offered the lead role of Mitch Buchannon in "Baywatch", but turned down the role because he did not want to be seen as a sex symbol. The role eventually went to David Hasselhoff.
Surprising many of his fans, Selleck unexpectedly played the role of General Dwight D. Eisenhower in A&E's 2004 made-for-TV movie "". The movie showed the planning, politics, and preparation for the 1944 Invasion of Normandy, and Selleck was critically lauded for playing a cool, calm Eisenhower.
Selleck appeared in a recurring role on the acclaimed ABC drama "Boston Legal" as Ivan Tiggs—the troubled ex-husband of Shirley Schmidt (Candice Bergen)—and as novelist Robert B. Parker's character Jesse Stone in several CBS made-for-TV movies, earning a 2007 Emmy nomination for "".
Broadway.
In 2001, Selleck played the lead role of Murray in a Broadway revival of Herb Gardner's comedic play "A Thousand Clowns". It ran for only two months. Critics, though far from uniformly negative about Selleck's performance, generally compared it unfavorably to that of Jason Robards, Jr., who won awards in the 1960s for playing the character on the stage and in a movie version. (It remains the role with which Robards is most identified.) Playwright Gardner, however, actually preferred Selleck to Robards in the part, and even said that Selleck was the way he had always envisioned Murray.
Commercials.
Selleck did the voice-over for the 1993 AT&T advertising campaigns titled "You Will." These advertisements had a futuristic feel, and posed the question of, "What if you had the technology to ______ ? Well, you will ... and the company that will bring it to you? AT&T." As of December 30, 2007, he began doing commercial voice-overs for Florida orange juice, a move that one writer quipped would have a "magnum" impact on sales (referring to the actor's role in "Magnum, P.I"). As of March 2012, Selleck is featured in Coldwell Banker's new television ad campaign focusing on the deepest, most personal meanings of homeownership.
"The Practical Guide to the Universe".
In the mid-1990s, Selleck hosted a special series on TLC called "The Practical Guide to the Universe", in which he talked about the stars, planets, galaxies, and other things in the universe.
Awards and accolades.
On April 28, 2000, he received an honorary doctorate from Pepperdine University. He was chosen because of his outstanding character and ethic. He is a board member of the non-profit Joseph and Edna Josephson Institute of Ethics and co-founder of the Character Counts Coalition. Selleck received a Star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 1986. The star is situated at 6925 Hollywood Blvd.
In 1993, during the brief run of the late night "The Chevy Chase Show" on Fox, Selleck guest-starred. As a gag, he asked to be presented his 1992 Worst Supporting Actor Razzie award for his performance as King Ferdinand of Spain in "". When the Razzie was presented to him on the air, Selleck took it in stride and asked the entire studio audience to "blow me a raspberry." Thus Selleck became the third person in Razzie history to voluntarily accept one of the Worst Achievements in Film statuettes.
Personal life.
From 1971 to 1982, Selleck was married to model Jacqueline Ray. During that time, he adopted her son, Kevin (born 1966).
On August 7, 1987, Selleck married Jillie Mack. They have one daughter, Hannah Margaret Selleck (born December 16, 1988). The family lives in Freedom, California, and Thousand Oaks, California. Selleck has a summer residence in Jonesboro, Maine. In the 1980s—specifically around the time of filming "Three Men and a Baby"—Selleck also owns a home on upscale Lakeshore Road in Burlington, Ontario, a city southwest of Toronto.
Selleck lives on an avocado farm. In an interview with "Good Housekeeping", Selleck talked about living and working on his farm, "So I like to get outside and work on the farm, from fixing roads to clearing brush. I hate going to the gym, so sweating outdoors sure beats sitting on a stationary bike staring at my navel. And I work cheaper than anyone I could hire to do it."
He is an accomplished indoor and beach volleyball player playing the outside hitter position for the Outrigger Canoe Club, Honolulu. His adopted son, Kevin Shepard, attended Selleck's alma mater, the University of Southern California, and became an All-American in 1990. Outrigger Canoe Club team mate Dennis Berg was quoted in the summer 2011 issue of Volleyball USA magazine saying of Selleck, "Tom was a great team mate, appreciative of being included with such a talented and experienced group, practicing and playing hard when his Magnum schedule permitted. ... He was very patient with all of us, and we relished the big crowds that replaced the usual sparse number of players' friends and spouses at the national tourney matches."
Selleck is an avid ice hockey fan and has been seen attending Los Angeles Kings games at the Staples Center. He lists Anze Kopitar and Alexander Frolov as two of his favorite players. He was once a minority owner of his favorite baseball team since childhood, the Baltimore Orioles. 
One of Selleck's "Magnum" co-stars, Larry Manetti, in his 1996 memoir "Aloha Magnum", was lavish in his praise of Selleck. Manetti lauded Selleck for his extraordinary work ethic on a grueling show (shooting for hours in the midday Hawaiian sun), Selleck's work with Hawaiian charities and his willingness to go to bat for the program's cast and crew members.
In February 2009, Selleck joined the Vietnam Veterans Memorial Fund as national spokesman for the new Education Center being built on the National Mall.
Political views and the NRA.
To promote his film "The Love Letter", Selleck was invited to be on "The Rosie O'Donnell Show" on May 19, 1999. However, he found himself defending an ad in which he appeared supporting the National Rifle Association (NRA) and his position on gun ownership. Selleck said, "It's your show, and you can talk about it after I leave." O'Donnell was highly criticized; it was criticism which led her to make an apology to Selleck by saying, "For him feeling embarrassed and humiliated by me, I strongly do apologize to him personally, but I do not apologize for my feelings about the issue of gun control."
Selleck is a member of the Board of Directors and public spokesman of the NRA. After close friend Charlton Heston stepped down—due to failing health—as the highly visible public spokesman of the NRA in 2003, Selleck has stepped up in comparable manner to succeed him. In 2002, Selleck donated the rifle he used in "Quigley Down Under" (a custom 13-pound single-shot, 1874 Sharps Rifle, with a 34-inch [86-cm barrel), along with six other firearms from his other films, to the National Rifle Association, as part of the NRA's exhibit "Real Guns of Reel Heroes" at the National Firearms Museum in Fairfax, Virginia.
For a number of years, Selleck appeared in television advertising for "The National Review" (he also subscribes to "The New Republic"). He endorsed Senator John McCain in the 2008 presidential election. Selleck describes himself politically as "a registered independent with a lot of libertarian leanings." In a 2012 magazine article about his career, he mentioned that he likes the fact that his character on "Blue Bloods" and his family are visibly practicing Catholics, while adding that he is not very religious himself.

WrestleMania 29 will be the 29th annual WrestleMania professional wrestling pay-per-view (PPV) event produced by WWE, and will be held on April 7, 2013 at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey. It is expected to draw about 90,000 fans. The event will be the fifth WrestleMania in the New York metropolitan area following WrestleMania I, X, and XX having been held at Madison Square Garden while a portion of WrestleMania 2 was held at Nassau Coliseum. It will be the third WrestleMania held in the state of New Jersey after WrestleMania IV and V, both of which were held at Trump Plaza/Boardwalk Hall in Atlantic City.
Background.
WrestleMania 29 will feature professional wrestling matches involving different wrestlers from pre-existing scripted feuds, plots, and storylines that play out on WWE's television programs. Wrestlers portray heels or faces as they followed a series of events that build tension, and culminate in a wrestling match or series of matches.
On January 27, 2013, John Cena won the 2013 Royal Rumble match, making him a two-time Rumble winner. In doing so, he earned a WWE Championship or World Heavyweight Championship match at WrestleMania 29. The next night on the January 28 edition of "Raw", he announced that he will challenge the reigning WWE Champion. At the Elimination Chamber event on February 17, 2013, The Rock successfully defended the WWE Championship against CM Punk. The following night on "Raw", Punk would challenge Cena for his spot in the main event, which Cena accepted. Should Cena win, it would set up a rematch of his match with The Rock from WrestleMania XXVIII.
Also at Elimination Chamber, World Heavyweight Champion Alberto Del Rio successfully retained his championship against Big Show. A returning Jack Swagger won the six-man Elimination Chamber match against Chris Jericho, Daniel Bryan, Kane, Mark Henry and Randy Orton to become the number one contender for the World Heavyweight Championship, and will challenge Del Rio for the title at WrestleMania.
Production.
Tickets went on sale on 10 November 2012, and WWE set a first-day sales record of 52,029 tickets, beating the WrestleMania X8 record of 51,620 tickets. This also set a first-day revenue record of more than $10 million, which topped WrestleMania XXVIII's $6.3 million (due in part to increased ticket prices).

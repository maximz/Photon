The MacBook Pro is a line of Macintosh portable computers introduced in January 2006 by Apple Inc., and now in its third generation. Replacing the PowerBook G4, the MacBook Pro was the second model, after the iMac, to be announced in the Apple–Intel transition. It is also the high-end model of the MacBook family and is currently produced with 13- and 15-inch screens, although a 17-inch version has been offered previously.
The first generation MacBook Pro appeared externally similar to the PowerBook G4, but used the Intel Core processors instead of PowerPC G4 chips. The 15-inch model was released in January 2006, a 17-inch model in April, both of which received several updates and Core 2 Duo processors later in the year.
The second model, known as the "unibody" model, has a more tapered design and a casing made from a single block of aluminum. It debuted in October 2008 as the 15-inch MacBook Pro and the 13-inch aluminum unibody MacBook. The following January brought the design to the 17-inch model, along with the built-in battery that joined the rest of the MacBook Pro line in June, including the 13-inch model which Apple absorbed into the MacBook Pro line. Subsequent updates brought upgraded Intel Core i5 and i7 processors and introduced Intel's Thunderbolt technology. 
Apple released the third generation of MacBook Pro in June 2012 as a 15-inch screen size only. At the same time, slightly updated versions of the previous 13- and 15-inch unibody models were announced that will sell in parallel, although Apple has delisted and discontinued the 17-inch variant. While dimensionally smaller than its predecessor, the similarly styled third generation model still retains a unibody form factor. Specification-wise, the most substantial differences in the next-generation MacBook Pro are the fitting of a significantly higher resolution Retina display, the elimination of the optical drive, and replacement of hard disk drives with solid-state drives. A third generation 13-inch MacBook Pro was released on October 23, 2012. As with the 15-inch, it includes a Retina display.
First generation.
The original 15-inch MacBook Pro was announced on January 10, 2006, by Steve Jobs at the Macworld Conference & Expo. The 17-inch model was unveiled on April 24, 2006. The first design was largely a carryover from the PowerBook G4, but used Intel Core CPUs instead of PowerPC G4 chips. The 15-inch Macbook Pro weighed the same as the 15-inch aluminum PowerBook G4, but was deeper, wider, and thinner. Other changes from the PowerBook include a built-in iSight webcam and the inclusion of MagSafe, a magnetic power connector designed to detach easily when pulled to prevent the entire laptop from being pulled off a surface. Both features were later brought over to the MacBook. In order to fit into the slimmer MacBook Pro, the optical drive was half the speed of the one in the PowerBook G4 and could not write to dual layer DVDs.
Both the original 15- and 17-inch model MacBook Pros come with ExpressCard/34 slots, which replace the PC Card slots found in the PowerBook G4. All pre-unibody 15-inch models have two USB 2.0 ports and one FireWire 400 port, while the 17-inch models have three USB 2.0 ports as well as one FireWire 400 port. When first introduced, the MacBook Pro did not come with FireWire 800 or S-Video ports, although FireWire 800 was added in the next 15-inch model revision and was present in every version of the 17-inch design. S-Video capability can be attained through the use of a DVI to S-Video adapter. External displays with up to a 2,560 × 1,600 pixel resolution are supported through a dual-link DVI port. All models include a built-in Gigabit Ethernet port, Bluetooth 2.0, and 802.11a/b/g. Later models include support for the draft 2.0 specification of 802.11n and Bluetooth 2.1.
Updates.
Apple refreshed the entire MacBook Pro line on October 24, 2006, to include Intel Core 2 Duo processors. Memory capacity was doubled for each model, to 1 GB on the low-end 15-inch and 2 GB for the high-end 15- and 17-inch models. FireWire 800 was added to the 15-inch models. Hard drive capacity was increased, although video card options stayed the same. The MacBook Pro line received a second update on June 5, 2007 with new Nvidia Geforce 8600M GT video cards and faster processor options. LED backlighting was added to the 15-inch model's screen, and its weight was reduced from to . Furthermore, the speed of the front-side bus was increased from 667 MHz to 800 MHz. On November 1, 2007, Apple added the option of a 2.6 GHz Santa Rosa platform Core 2 Duo CPU as well as reconfigured hard drive options.
On February 26, 2008, the MacBook Pro line was again updated. LED backlighting was added as an option for the 17-inch model. Processors were updated to "Penryn" cores, which are built on the 45 nanometer process (65 nanometer "Merom" cores were previously used), and hard drive and memory capacities were increased. Multi-touch capabilities, first introduced with the MacBook Air earlier that year, were brought over to the MacBook Pro's trackpad. At the time of the introduction of the 15-inch unibody MacBook Pro on October 14, 2008, the pre-unibody model with the same screen size was discontinued, while the 17-inch pre-unibody model continued to be sold. The original case design was discontinued on January 6, 2009, when the 17-inch MacBook Pro was also updated with unibody construction.
Reception.
Reviewers applauded the MacBook Pro, which was speedier than the PowerBook G4, with two- or threefold improvements in performance in some areas. For example, the 3D rendering program Cinema 4D XL was 3.3 times faster and the boot-up time was more than halved. The MacBook Pro generally outperformed the PowerBook G4 in performance analyzer utility tests, XBench and Cinebench. Reviewers lauded the screen's maximum brightness, 67 percent higher than the PowerBook G4; the excellent horizontal viewing angles; the matte options; and the bright, crisp, and true colors. Although the screen offered fewer vertical pixels (1,440 × 900 in the MacBook Pro instead of 1,440 × 960 in the PowerBook), one reviewer called the screen "nothing less than stellar". Reviewers praised the new MagSafe power adapter, although one reviewer said it disconnected too easily in some instances. They also praised the backlit keyboard, large trackpad, and the virtually silent operation of the machine. The new laptop also offered better wireless performance.
Reviewers criticized the decision to underclock the ATI Mobility Radeon X1600 graphics card by about 30 percent its original speed. The notebook was also noted for running hot. Users complained that upgrading system memory was harder than in older Apple notebooks. Since the dimensions for the 15-inch MacBook Pro were tweaked slightly from the 15-inch PowerBook G4, older accessories such as notebook sleeves did not work with the new models. Some users noted a slight flickering when the screen was on lower brightness settings. Battery life remained about the same three-plus hours as in previous models, on par with or better than the competition. Apple added 10 watt-hours (Wh), going from 50 in the PowerBook G4 to 60, but the more powerful Core Duo CPU required more power.
Second generation (unibody).
On October 14, 2008, in a press event at company headquarters, Apple officials announced a new 15-inch MacBook Pro featuring a "precision aluminum unibody enclosure" and tapered sides similar to those of the MacBook Air. Designers shifted the MacBook Pro's ports to the left side of the case, and moved the optical disc drive slot from the front to the right side, similar to the MacBook. The new MacBook Pros had two new video cards: the Nvidia GeForce 9600M GT with either 256 or 512 MB of dedicated memory and a GeForce 9400M with 256 MB of shared system memory. The FireWire 400 port was removed but the FireWire 800 port was retained, and the DVI port was replaced with a Mini DisplayPort receptacle. The original unibody MacBook Pro came with a user-removable battery; Apple claimed five hours of use, but reviewers reported results closer to four. Apple said that the battery would hold 80 percent of its charge after 300 recharges.
Design.
The unibody-construction MacBook Pro largely follows the styling of the original aluminum iMac and the MacBook Air and is slightly thinner than its predecessor, albeit wider and deeper due to the widescreen display. The screen is high-gloss, covered by an edge-to-edge reflective glass finish, while an anti-glare matte option is available in the 15- and 17-inch models in which the glass panel is removed. The trackpad has also been enlarged, giving more room for scrolling and multi-touch gestures. When the line was updated in April 2010, inertial scrolling was added, making the scrolling experience much like that of the iPhone and iPad. The entire touchpad is usable and acts as a clickable button. The keys, still backlit, are now that of Apple's now-standard sunken keyboard with separated black keys.
Updates.
At the MacWorld Expo keynote on January 6, 2009, Phil Schiller announced a 17-inch MacBook Pro with unibody construction. This version diverged from its 15-inch sibling with an anti-glare "matte" screen option (with the glossy finish standard) and a non user-removable lithium polymer battery. Apple affirmed the battery's design was unlike any existing notebook battery. Instead of traditional round cells inside the casing, the lithium-ion polymer batteries are shaped and fitted into each laptop without wasting space. Adaptive charging extends battery life, which uses a chip to optimize the charge flow to reduce wear and tear. Compared to the previous iteration, battery life for the 17" version is quoted at eight hours, with 80 percent of this charge remaining after 1,000 charge-discharge cycles. This battery is not intended to be user-removable.
At Apple's Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) on June 8, 2009, it was announced that the 13-inch unibody MacBook would be upgraded and re-branded as a MacBook Pro, leaving only the white polycarbonate MacBook in the MacBook line. It was also announced that the entire MacBook Pro line would use the non user-removable battery inherited from the 17-inch MacBook Pro. The updated MacBook Pro 13- and the 15-inch would each have up to a claimed seven hours of battery life, while the 17-inch would keep its eight-hour capacity. Some sources even reported up to eight hours of battery life for the 13- and 15-inch MacBook Pros during casual use, while others reported around six hours. Like the 17-inch MacBook Pro, Apple claims that they will last around 1,000 charge cycles while still containing 80 percent of their capacity. Graphics card options stayed the same from the previous release, although the 13-inch, and the base model 15-inch, came with only the GeForce 9400M GPU. The screens were also improved, gaining a claimed 60 percent greater color gamut. All of these mid 2009 models also included a FireWire 800 port and all except the 17-inch models would receive an SD card slot. The 17-inch model would retain its ExpressCard/34 slot. For the 13-inch MacBook Pro, the Kensington lock slot was moved to the right side of computer body. In August 2009, Apple extended the "matte" anti-glare display option to the 15-inch MacBook Pro.
On April 13, 2010, the MacBook Pro saw another update. Intel Core i5 and Core i7 CPUs were introduced in the 15- and 17-inch models, while the 13-inch retained the Core 2 Duo with a speed increase. The power brick was redesigned and a high-resolution display (of 1,680 × 1,050) was announced as an option for the 15-inch models. For video cards, the 13-inch gained an integrated Nvidia GeForce 320M graphics processing unit (GPU) with 256 MB of shared memory, while the 15- and 17-inch models were upgraded to the GeForce GT 330M, with either 256 or 512 MB of dedicated memory. The 15" and 17" models also have an integrated Intel GPU that is built into the Core i5 and i7 processors. The 15-inch model also gained . Save for a third USB 2.0 slot, all the ports on the 17-inch MacBook Pro are the same in type and number as on the 15-inch version. All models come with 4 GB of system memory that is upgradeable to 8 GB across the board. Battery life was also extended further in this update, to an estimated ten hours for the 13-inch and 8–9 hours on the 15- and 17-inch MacBook Pros. This was achieved through greater power efficiency and adding more battery capacity. Through actual use, reviewers reported anywhere from six (in the 15-inch) to eight (in the 13-inch) hours of battery life.
The line was updated on February 24, 2011 with the introduction of Intel Thunderbolt technology and dual core Intel Core i5 and i7 (on 13-inch model) or quad-core i7 (on 15- and 17-inch models) Sandy Bridge processors as well as a high definition FaceTime camera. Intel HD Graphics 3000 come integrated with the CPU, while the 15- and 17-inch models also utilize graphics cards from AMD, the Radeon HD 6490M and Radeon HD 6750M models. The 2011 models also debuted Intel's Thunderbolt serial bus platform that can achieve speeds of up to 10 Gbit/s, which is up to twice as fast as the USB 3.0 specification, 20 times faster than the USB 2.0 specification, and up to 12 times faster than FireWire 800. Apple says that it can be used to drive displays or to transfer large quantities of data in a short amount of time.
On June 11, 2012, Apple showcased its upgraded Mac notebooks, OS X Mountain Lion, and iOS 6 at the Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) in San Francisco. The new MacBook Pro models were updated with Ivy Bridge processors and USB 3.0 ports, and the default RAM on premium models was increased to 8 GB. Following this announcement, the 17" model was discontinued.
Reception.
Reviewers praised the new laptop's compact size for its performance, the quality of the screen, and sturdy unibody build, which allowed easier upgrading of internal components as compared to the original models. Some reviewers also noted that the new MacBook Pro ran quieter and cooler. However, others criticized the amount of heat generated by the new design.
Reviewers lamented the loss of a matte screen option for the 2008 unibody MacBook Pro, noting the reflectiveness of the screen in sunlight, even when its brightness was turned all the way up. CNET's Dan Ackerman commented of the mid-2009 models, "According to Apple, the new display offers a wider color gamut, and the screen certainly looks bright and colorful, but we wish the same matte-screen option offered on the 17-inch MacBook Pro was available across the line... While the LED screen means a thinner lid and some battery life benefits, the edge-to-edge glass covering the entire display panel grabs stray light rays with ease, making the glossy screen hard to see in some lighting conditions." As of 2011, however, matte screens are offered for both the 15" and 17" models. Furthermore, the addition of Mini DisplayPort instead of the more popular HDMI was criticized. The relatively low number of ports and lower end technical specifications when compared to similarly priced laptops from other brands were also frowned upon.
"Laptop Magazine"s Michael Prospero praised the 2010 15-inch model's display, calling it "bright and crisp". He further commented, "While reflections from the glossy display weren't overwhelming, it's also nice to know there's an antiglare option—though only for the higher resolution display. Still, colors were bright, blacks were deep and dark, and viewing angles were excellent both vertically and horizontally." He also lauded the quality of the iSight webcam, the responsiveness of the touchpad, the microphone and speakers, as well as the performance of the new CPUs for the 15" model and the long battery life. Complaints included the price of the laptop, the low number of USB ports, and the lack of HDMI.
CNET praised the automatic graphics switching features of the 15- and 17-inch 2010 models as well as the graphics cards themselves. Acclaim was also given to the Core i5 and i7 CPUs, the multi-touch trackpad, and the addition of audio capabilities to the Mini DisplayPort video output. They also called for the addition of HDMI and the Blu-ray optical disc format, saying that most other computers in the MacBook Pro's price range possessed these features. CNET also criticized the option of a higher resolution screen in the 15-inch model, saying "the higher-resolution screen should be included by default."
Third generation (Retina).
On June 11, 2012, at the Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) in San Francisco Apple introduced a new third generation MacBook Pro, marketed as the "MacBook Pro with Retina display" to differentiate it from the updated models of the previous generation released earlier that day. The new model includes Intel's third generation Core i7 processors (Ivy Bridge microarchitecture) along with USB 3.0 integrated, and a high-resolution 15.4" IPS 2880x1800-pixel Retina display. Other new or changed features include a second Thunderbolt port, an HDMI port, and a new thinner MagSafe port, dubbed the 'MagSafe 2.
On October 23, 2012, Apple introduced in a keynote a new version of the third-generation MacBook Pro. This was a 13-inch version, very similar in specification to the 15-inch version but with slightly lower capabilities, such as less powerful processors and a 13-inch 2560x1600 pixel display, representing 227 pixels per inch. 
The new models omit Ethernet and FireWire 800 ports, though Apple offers Thunderbolt adapters for both interfaces. They also omit a SuperDrive, making the 15-inch model Apple's first professional notebook since the PowerBook 2400c to ship without a built-in optical drive. Instead of a hard disk drive the new models ship with a solid state drive standard in a proprietary flash module form factor rather than a 2.5" notebook drive. Apple also claims improved speakers and microphones and a new system for cooling the notebook with improved fans.
The Retina models are also significantly less user-accessible than previous MacBooks. Unlike the previous generations, the memory is soldered onto the logic board and thus not upgradable. Because of this, the amount of memory can only be chosen at time of purchase. The solid state drive is not soldered and can be replaced with a larger unit. The battery is glued into place; attempts to remove it may destroy the battery and/or trackpad. The entire case uses proprietary pentalobe screws and cannot be disassembled with standard tools. While the battery is glued in, recycling companies have stated that the design is only "mildly inconvenient" and does not hamper the recycling process.
The Retina models do not have a Kensington lock slot, so alternative products are required to physically secure them.
On February 13, 2013, Apple announced updated prices and processors for their MacBook Pro with Retina Display. The 13-inch MacBook Pro with Retina Display and 128GB flash storage now starts at $1,499, while the upgraded model with 256GB of flash storage now comes with a 2.6GHz processor for $1,699. Apple also announced that the 15-inch MacBook Pro with Retina Display now has a 2.4GHz processor. The top-line version of the 15-inch variant now comes with a 2.7GHz quad-core processor and 16GB of RAM. 
Design.
The Retina display MacBook Pros largely follow the styling of the previous generation with its aluminum enclosure and separated black keys. The most apparent body changes are a thinner chassis, and a display with a redesigned hinge and thinner bezel. The power button is now located on the keyboard rather than the upper right corner of the chassis. At thick the 15-inch model is 25 percent thinner than its predecessor. Unlike any previous Macintosh laptops the model name is not visible when the computer is in normal use as the model now has its name on the underside of the chassis rather than the screen bezel, where it had been located on all Macintosh laptops after the PowerBook 280c in 1995.
Reception.
The third generation MacBook Pro received overwhelmingly positive reviews because of the Retina display, flash storage, and power. It was criticized, however, because of the price and lack of an ethernet port and optical drive. Roman Loyola of "Macworld" said that the Retina MacBook Pro was "groundbreaking" and made people "rethink how they use technology." He praised the inclusion of USB 3.0 and the slimmer body. Dan Ackerman of CNET commented "I've previously called the 15-inch MacBook Pro one of the most universally useful all-around laptops you can buy. This new version adds to that with HDMI, faster ports, and more portability. But it also subtracts from that with its exclusion of an optical drive and Ethernet port, plus its very high starting price. The Pro and Retina Pro are clearly two laptops designed for two different users, and with the exception of all-day commuters who need something closer to a MacBook Air or ultrabook, one of the two branches of the MacBook Pro family tree is still probably the most universally useful laptop you can buy."
Joel Santo Domingo of "PC Magazine" gave the MacBook Pro an "Editor's Choice" rating. He praised “brilliant Retina display” the thin design, port selection and speedy storage, and highlighted the expansibility via Thunderbolt ports which support up to seven devices each. David Pogue of "The New York Times" praised the 15-inch model's screen, keyboard, sound, start-up time, cosmetics, battery life, storage, and RAM capacity, however criticized the lack of a SuperDrive, pricing, and compatibility of the MagSafe 2 connector.
Since the battery is glued in and cannot be easily disassembled for recycling (an EPEAT requirement), Apple received criticisms about the machine's ability to be recycled. Greenpeace spokesman Casey Harrell said Apple "has pitted design against the environment—and chosen design. They're making a big bet that people don't care, but recycling is a big issue."
The Retina display on the MacBook has been criticized for "image retention".
Software and operating systems.
The OS X operating system has been pre-installed on all MacBook Pros since release, starting with version 10.4.4 (Tiger). Along with OS X, iLife has also shipped with all systems, beginning with iLife '06.
The MacBook Pro comes with the BIOS successor, Extensible Firmware Interface (EFI) 1.1. EFI handles booting differently from conventional BIOS-based computers, but provides BIOS backwards compatibility, allowing dual and triple boot configurations. In addition to OS X, the Microsoft Windows operating system is installable on Intel x86-based Apple computers. Officially, this is limited to both 32-bit and 64-bit versions of Windows XP, Vista, and 7, with the necessary hardware drivers included with the Boot Camp software. Other x86 operating systems such as Linux are also unofficially supported. This is made possible by the presence of the Intel architecture as provided by the CPU and the BIOS emulation Apple has provided on top of EFI.
As the MacBook Pro uses a different hardware platform than earlier PowerPC (PPC)-based Macintoshes, versions of OS X prior to Lion can run PPC applications only via the Rosetta emulator, which exacts some performance penalty, cannot emulate some lower-level PPC code, and does not support 64-bit (G5 specific) PPC features. Rosetta is not present in Lion and later, so PPC applications cannot be run under those versions of OS X.

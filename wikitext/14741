After Earth (originally known as 1000 A.E.) is an upcoming American science-fiction thriller film directed by M. Night Shyamalan, starring real-life father and son Will and Jaden Smith as Cypher and Kitai Raige. It will be distributed by Columbia Pictures.
Synopsis.
In the near future, humanity was forced to abandon the planet forever after events, and they reestablished mankind on the planet Nova Prime, light years away from Earth, and managed to rebuild society. Earth was left in its prime state, and continued to live on its own.
1,000 years later, a crash-landing of a small ship leaves teenager Kitai Raige (Jaden Smith) and his father, army General Cypher Raige (Will Smith) stranded. With Cypher critically injured, Kitai must embark on a perilous journey to signal for help so they can return to Nova Prime, facing uncharted terrain, evolved animal species that now rule the planet, and an unstoppable alien creature that escaped during the crash. The father and son must learn to work together and learn to trust one another if they want any chance of escaping Earth and returning home.
Production.
Principal photography for "After Earth" began in February 2012. The script was originally written by Gary Whitta, rewritten by Shyamalan and finally polished by Stephen Gaghan in late 2011. Much of the filming took place in Costa Rica; Humboldt County, California; and Aston, Pennsylvania. Filming of "After Earth" was done using Sony's CineAlta F65 camera, which was shipped in January 2012.
Marketing.
Initial marketing for After Earth began online with an Internet marketing campaign on Facebook, including a teaser trailer. Alongside the Facebook marketing is a Web 2.0 site that lets people "scroll" through different images and paragraphs in a complex dynamic way. An image of Jaden's character in costume was released online on February 15, 2012. Later in the year, a theatrical trailer was released alongside a trailer for the competing Tom Cruise movie Oblivion.

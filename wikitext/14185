In linguistics and grammar, a pronoun is a word or form that substitutes for a noun or noun phrase. It is a particular case of a pro-form.
Pronouns have traditionally been regarded as one of the parts of speech, although many modern theorists would not regard them as a single distinct word class, because of the variety of functions performed by words which are classed as pronouns. Common types include the personal pronouns, relative pronouns, interrogative pronouns, demonstrative pronouns and indefinite pronouns.
The use of pronouns often involves anaphora, where the meaning of the pronoun is dependent on another referential element. This applies particularly to the (third-person) personal pronouns. The referent of the pronoun is often the same as that of a preceding (or sometimes following) noun phrase, called the "antecedent" of the pronoun. For example, in the sentence "That poor man looks as if he needs a new coat", the antecedent of the pronoun "he" is the noun phrase "that poor man". (Pronouns used without antecedents are sometimes called "unprecursed" pronouns.) Another type of antecedent is that found with relative pronouns, as in "the woman who looked at you", where "the woman" is the antecedent of the relative pronoun "who".
Pronouns and determiners.
Pronouns and determiners are closely related, and some linguists think pronouns are actually determiners without a noun or a noun phrase. The following chart shows their relationships in English.
Pronominals.
A pronominal is a phrase that acts as a pronoun. For example, in "I want that kind", the phrase "that kind" stands for a noun phrase that can be deduced from context, and may thus be called a pronominal.

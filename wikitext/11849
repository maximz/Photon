This is a list of films produced by the Bollywood film industry of Mumbai ordered by year and decade of release and also contains the top ten or forty superhit films of respective years as the case may be. Although "Bollywood" films are generally listed under the Hindi language, most are in mixed Hindi, Urdu and Punjabi and occasionally other languages. There is a range of mixtures from mostly Urdu to mostly Hindi to mostly Punjabi. Speakers of Hindi, Urdu, and Punjabi understand the mixed language usage of Bollywood thus extending the viewership to people all over the Indian subcontinent (throughout India and its neighboring countries). Here are some examples - Partly Hindi: "Om Shanti Om", "Dhoom 2", "No Entry" and "Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna", Partly Urdu: "Jodhaa Akbar", "Fanaa", "Saawariya" and "Kurbaan", Partly Punjabi: "Singh Is Kinng", "Jab We Met", "Patiala House" and "Rab Ne Bana Di Jodi". The film "Veer Zaara" is an equal mix of Hindi, Punjabi and Urdu.

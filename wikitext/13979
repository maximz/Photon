The following tables list the 100 largest languages in the world by native speakers, roughly corresponding to languages with more than 7.5 million estimated native speakers, ordered by number of speakers. Two lists are given, which disagree in many particulars; other estimates will vary again, and the numbers should be taken as no more than an indication of the rough order of magnitude of a linguistic community.
Since the definition of a single language is to some extent arbitrary, some mutually intelligible idioms with separate national standards or self-identification have been listed together, including Indonesian and Malay; Croatian, Bosnian and Serbian etc.
For a list of the smallest languages in the world, please see Lists of endangered languages.
"Nationalencyklopedin" (2007).
The estimates used for this list are those of "Nationalencyklopedin" and is based on estimates published in 2007. As census methods in different countries vary to a considerable extent, and some countries do not record language in their censuses, any list of languages by native speakers, or total speakers, is based on estimates.
"Ethnologue" (2009).
The following list derives from SIL Ethnologue. "Ethnologue" lists 1,300 languages with 100,000 speakers or more, 750 with 300,000 or more, some 400 with a million or more, 200 with at least 3 million, 80 with 10 million, and 40 with 30 million. Figures are accompanied by dates the data was collected; for many languages, an old date means that the current number of speakers will be substantially greater. A range of dates means that the figure is the sum of data from more than one country and from different years.

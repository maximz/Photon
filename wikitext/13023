Haswell is the codename for a processor microarchitecture under development by Intel's Oregon team as the successor to the Ivy Bridge architecture. Using the 22 nm process, Intel is expected to release CPUs based on this microarchitecture around June 2, 2013 according to leaked roadmaps. With Haswell, Intel will introduce a new low-power processor designed for convertible or 'hybrid' Ultrabooks, having the Y suffix. Intel demonstrated a working Haswell chip at the 2011 Intel Developer Forum.
Design.
The Haswell architecture is designed specially to optimize the power savings and performance benefits from the move to FinFET transistors on the improved 22 nm process node.
